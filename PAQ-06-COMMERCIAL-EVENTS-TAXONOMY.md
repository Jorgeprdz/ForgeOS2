PAQ 6
### Commercial Events Taxonomy

### Purpose

Define the canonical conceptual event taxonomy for Forge OS.

This document is architecture only.
It does not create code, engines, schemas, UI, implementation plans or commits.

### Core principle

Events are records that something happened, was decided, was interpreted, was paid, was corrected or was experienced.

Events must not collapse facts, interpretations, payments, decisions, snapshots and corrections into one generic category.

Forge must preserve event meaning so it can explain any historical fact, decision, payment, attribution, correction or interpretation within 10 years.


1. Event Definition

An event is a time-bound record that something meaningful happened in Forge or in a source system.

### An event must answer

- what happened;
- when it happened;
- who or what it affected;
- what source or evidence supports it;
- what domain owns the event meaning;
- whether it is a fact, interpretation, decision, payment, correction, system action or experience signal;
- what prior events, rules, evidence or snapshots it depends on.


### What is an event

- A policy was issued.
- A policy was paid.
- A commission was posted.
- An advisor connected.
- A contest qualification was evaluated.
- A bonus was accrued.
- A bonus was paid.
- LIMRA was reported.
- Attribution was assigned.
- Servicing changed.
- A command was executed.
- A feature was learned.
- A correction was applied.


### What is NOT an event

### Metric

### Example
Advisor has 4 paid policies.

Metrics are values derived from facts, rules and periods.

### Rule

### Example
GMM counts as 0.5 for a contest.

Rules interpret events.

### Snapshot

### Example
ContestPolicyCountSnapshot for Semester 1.

Snapshots capture state or metric at a period boundary.

### State

### Example
Advisor is in Development.

State may be produced by events, but it is not the event itself.

### Interpretation

### Example
Advisor qualified for Bono Inicial.

Interpretation can be recorded as an interpretation event, but the conclusion itself is not a raw fact.

### Recommendation

### Example
Contact this client today.

Recommendation may produce a recommendation event, but it is not a production fact.

### Prediction

### Example
Advisor may earn $12,000 more.

Prediction is forecast/interpretation, not fact.


### Boundary rule

Events are historical records.
Metrics are values.
Rules are decision constraints.
Snapshots are preserved state.
Interpretations are results of applying rules.
Recommendations are suggested actions.
Predictions are future-oriented estimates.


2. Event Taxonomy

Forge needs official event categories.

### Canonical categories

3. Fact vs Interpretation Model

### Fact events

Fact events record something that happened outside or inside Forge and can be supported by evidence or source system record.

### Examples

### - Policy_paid.
### - Policy_cancelled.
### - Contract_signed.
### - Carrier_report_received.
### - Commission_posted.

Fact events do not decide eligibility.


### Interpretation events

Interpretation events record a conclusion produced by applying rules to facts.

### Examples

### - Contest_policy_count_updated.
### - Contest_qualified.
### - Advisor_class_determined.
### - Limra_applied_to_period.

Interpretation events require RuleSnapshot and PeriodSnapshot.


### Decision events

Decision events record acceptance, approval, qualification or readiness.

### Examples

### - Bonus_eligibility_approved.
### - Precontract_ready.
### - Advisor_compensation_qualified.

Decision events usually depend on interpretation events.


### Payment events

Payment events record money state changes.

### Examples

### - Bonus_accrued.
### - Bonus_paid.
### - Commission_reversed.

Payment events require compensation rule and financial provenance.


### Correction events

Correction events record change to prior event meaning, validity, amount or attribution.

### Examples

### - Event_corrected.
### - Bonus_recalculated.
### - Attribution_corrected.

Correction events do not erase the original event.


### System events

System events record operational actions.

### Examples

### - Command_executed.
### - Period_closed.
### - Import_completed.


### Experience events

Experience events record learning, discovery or advisor interaction signals.

### Examples

### - Feature_learned.
### - Help_accepted.
### - Baseline_created.


### Classification examples

POLICY_PAID:
### Fact Event.

POLICY_CANCELLED:
### Fact Event.

CONTEST_QUALIFIED:
INTERPRETATION EVENT or DECISION EVENT depending on finality.

BONUS_CALCULATED:
### Interpretation Event.

BONUS_PAID:
### Payment Event.

LIMRA_UPDATED:
INTERPRETATION EVENT or SNAPSHOT EVENT. It is not a raw fact unless it is directly "carrier report received".

IGC_UPDATED:
INTERPRETATION EVENT or SNAPSHOT EVENT. It is not raw fact unless it records a reported index.

COMMAND_EXECUTED:
### System Event.

HELP_DISMISSED:
### Experience Event.


### Rule

The event name should make the event type obvious. If a name can mean fact and interpretation, rename it.

### Taxonomy rule

Relationship explains connection.
Assignment explains formal responsibility.
Attribution explains credit.
Servicing explains operational care.


10. Advisor Experience Events Model

Advisor Experience Events record adoption, discovery, learning and help interaction.

They are real events but not business facts.


### Feature_introduced

### Category
### Experience Event.

### Meaning
Forge introduced a feature to the advisor.

### Does not mean

- advisor learned the feature;

### Event vs state

FEATURE_LEARNED event records transition.

Feature Learning State is current/preserved state.

HELP_DISMISSED event records action.

Suppressed state is resulting state.


11. Event Lifecycle Model

### Events are born from

- source system import;
- user/manager action;
- system calculation;
- rule application;
- payment posting;
- correction;
- command execution;
- advisor experience interaction.


### Event layers

Layer 1: Source / Fact Events

### Examples

### - Policy_paid.
### - Contract_signed.
### - Carrier_report_received.


Layer 2: Normalization / Provenance Events

### Examples

### - Field_parsed.
### - Product_detected.
### - Source_record_normalized.


Layer 3: Interpretation Events

### Examples

### - Policy_count_updated.
### - Contest_group_assigned.
### - Limra_snapshot_created.


Layer 4: Decision Events

### Examples

### - Contest_qualified.
### - Advisor_compensation_qualified.
### - Bonus_eligibility_approved.


Layer 5: Financial Events

### Examples

### - Bonus_calculated.
### - Bonus_accrued.
### - Bonus_paid.


Layer 6: Action / Experience Events

### Examples

### - Command_executed.
### - Help_accepted.
### - Feature_learned.


Layer 7: Correction Events

### Examples

### - Event_corrected.
### - Bonus_recalculated.
### - Attribution_corrected.


### Example lifecycle

### Policy_paid

### Generates or contributes to

### - Raw_policy_count_updated.
### - Contest_policy_count_updated.
### - Contest_qualified.
### - Bonus_calculated.
### - Bonus_accrued.
### - Bonus_paid.

### But

Each downstream event is separate.
Each downstream event has its own owner, rule, period and provenance.


### Lifecycle invariants

- Events should be append-only conceptually.
- Later events can correct or invalidate prior events.
- Later events do not delete prior events.
- Derived events must reference source events.
- Interpretation events must reference rules.
- Payment events must reference financial evidence.
- Correction events must reference what they correct.


12. Correction Model

A prior event should not be modified silently.

Corrections must create new events.


### Event correction

Use when an event value was wrong.

### Example
POLICY_PAID amount was imported incorrectly.

### Creates
EVENT_CORRECTED or POLICY_PAYMENT_CORRECTED.

### Preserves
original event.


### Reversal

Use when a financial or production effect is reversed.

### Example
COMMISSION_REVERSED or BONUS_REVERSED.

### Does not erase
original commission or bonus event.


### Recalculation

Use when a calculated result changes due to new facts, corrected facts or rule correction.

### Example
### Bonus_recalculated.

### Preserves
prior calculation and new calculation.


### Override

Use when an authorized person or process overrides a value or decision.

### Requires

- authority;
- reason;
- evidence;
- provenance;
- effective time;
- correction time.


### Invalidation

Use when event should no longer be considered valid.

### Example
duplicate import, fraudulent record, invalid source.

### Preserves
invalidated event.


Can an event be modified?

Conceptually no.

Operational systems may update records, but the domain model must preserve event history.


### Correction invariants

- Original event remains explainable.
- Correction event references original event.
- Correction event has correction time.
- Correction event has reason and source.
- Downstream impacts are explicit.
- Recalculation creates new interpretation/payment events.


13. Riesgos críticos

1. POLICY_PAID used directly as contest qualification.
2. BONUS_PAID used to infer bonus eligibility.
3. LIMRA_UPDATED hides whether value was reported, calculated or applied.
4. CLIENT_ASSIGNED hides assignment vs servicing.
5. REFERRAL_CREATED hides relationship vs attribution.
6. FEATURE_LEARNED treated as raw behavior fact.
7. COMMISSION_REVERSED hides source reversal vs Forge reversal.
8. POLICY_REINSTATED treated as new production.
9. CONTEST_QUALIFIED created without RuleSnapshot.
10. BONUS_CALCULATED created without PeriodSnapshot.
11. Payment event overwrites accrual event.
12. Recalculation overwrites original calculation.
13. Correction modifies original event silently.
14. Late import uses reporting time as event time.
15. Duplicate event counted twice.
16. Invalid event not preserved with invalidation reason.
17. Event without evidence supports financial output.
18. Contradictory evidence produces two active facts without resolution.
19. Command OS executes on stale interpretation event.
20. Advisor Experience displays unofficial derived event.
21. Career event merges contract signed, advisor alta and contest date.
22. Manager assignment change reattributes old events.
23. Attribution correction recalculates payment without trace.
24. Conservation update applies wrong reporting month.
25. Generic event names hide domain ownership.


14. Recomendaciones obligatorias

1. Define official event categories before Foundation Lock.
2. Ban generic event names that hide meaning.
3. Separate fact events from interpretation events.
4. Separate decision events from payment events.
5. Separate correction events from reversal events.
6. Separate relationship events from attribution events.
7. Separate assignment events from servicing events.
8. Separate source report received from metric updated.
9. Preserve original events conceptually.
10. Corrections must create new events.
11. Recalculations must create new events.
12. Reversals must create new events.
13. Invalidations must preserve invalidated event.
14. Interpretation events must reference RuleSnapshot.
15. Interpretation events must reference PeriodSnapshot.
16. Payment events must reference financial evidence/provenance.
17. Derived events must reference source events.
18. Late imports must preserve both Event Time and Reporting Time.
19. Duplicate event handling must be defined.
20. Event ownership must be assigned by domain.
21. Career events must be split into precise lifecycle events.
22. Conservation events must distinguish report, snapshot and application.
23. Advisor Experience events must not become business facts.
24. Command OS events must not imply business success unless downstream event confirms it.
25. Red Team scenarios must pass before Foundation Lock.


15. ¿Está listo para FOUNDATION LOCK?

No.

### Status
FOUNDATION HARDENING REQUIRED.

The Shared Commercial Model cannot be locked until Commercial Events Taxonomy is formalized.

### Ready for FOUNDATION CANDIDATE when

- event definition is accepted;
- canonical event categories are accepted;
- event ownership is accepted;
- production events are separated from downstream interpretations;
- compensation events distinguish calculation, accrual, payment, reversal and recalculation;
- relationship, assignment, servicing and attribution events are separated;
- correction model is accepted.

### Ready for FOUNDATION LOCK only if the event model survives

1. POLICY_PAID corregido.
2. BONO recalculado.
3. Regla corregida.
4. Cambio de atribucion.
5. Cambio de manager.
6. Poliza rehabilitada.
7. Comision revertida.
8. Evento duplicado.
9. Evento importado tarde.
10. Evento invalido.
11. Evento sin evidencia.
12. Evento con evidencia contradictoria.

### Verdict

Forge cannot explain its commercial intelligence unless it knows what kind of event it is dealing with.

The event taxonomy is foundational because every future calculation, recommendation, payment, correction, attribution and learning signal depends on events being semantically clean.


16. Calificación arquitectónica

8/10.

The direction is strong and now has enough conceptual separation to support Foundation Candidate.

It is not yet Foundation Lock because event names, ownership and correction semantics must be formally incorporated into the Shared Commercial Model.

### Critical remaining hardening

- exact event naming discipline;
- event owner by family;
- correction and invalidation semantics;
- late import handling;
- duplicate event handling;
- conservation report vs snapshot distinction;
- career lifecycle precision;
- relationship vs attribution vs servicing split.

Once these are formalized, Forge can preserve event history and explain decisions without collapsing facts, interpretations and payments into the same conceptual bucket.
