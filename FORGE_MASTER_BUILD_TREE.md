## Current Evidence Status

Status source: BUILD-TREE-001A read-only evidence map after `/docs` canonicalization closure.

Rules:

- File existence is not enough to mark a branch complete.
- Completed means backed by canonical docs, tracked implementation, tests or harness evidence.
- Partner Compensation Candidate Foundation Subset remains IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE, and the Monthly Income Candidate Orchestrator is CLOSED / PUSHED as candidate calculation coverage; Partner Compensation overall remains PARTIAL / ACTIVE WORKSTREAM until payout truth and official statement/payment operations exist.
- Broader Compensation Intelligence, official statement ingestion, payout operations and Partner Intelligence remain future scope.
- Candidate calculators are not payout truth; `payoutTruth=true` requires official confirmed evidence and a statement line.
- Unknown is not zero, and ownership source truth remains protected.

**Confidence Levels:**
- Advisor OS: NEEDS_REVIEW (prior percentage removed from evidence status)
- Manager OS: NEEDS_REVIEW (governance framework exists; org/leadership/metrics remain pending or review)
- Shared Layer: IMPLEMENTED FOUNDATION + ongoing fixture/taxonomy hardening

**Final Verdict:** Forge OS is now a **Dual-Engine System**. Governance and Execution are officially decoupled.

## Partner Compensation Closure Correction — Status Truth

Partner Compensation overall is **PARTIAL / ACTIVE WORKSTREAM**.

The **Partner Compensation Candidate Foundation Subset** is **IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE / MONTHLY INCOME CANDIDATE CLOSED**.

Full candidate completeness is **IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE / CLOSED FOR CANDIDATE COVERAGE**.

Implemented candidate concepts:
- Productividad Base
- Multiplicador de Productividad
- Bono de Produccion
- Bono de Actividad
- Bono de Alta Partner
- Bono de Conexion
- Bono de Desarrollo
- Bono de Transicion
- Bono Adicional Anual de Productividad
- Apoyos

Partial candidate concepts / active gaps:
- None

Boundary:
- `candidateAmount` is not `payoutTruth`.
- `payoutTruth=true` remains `BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE` for all PCV concepts until official statement/account ingestion and statement line match exist.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Ownership source truth remains protected.
