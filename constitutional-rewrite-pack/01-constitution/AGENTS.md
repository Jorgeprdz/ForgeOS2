## Architecture Principles

### Engine-Based Architecture

Forge is composed of small specialized engines.

Pattern:

Input
↓
Engine
↓
Actionable Output

---

### Universal Core / Rule Pack Boundary

Forge Core is universal.

Rule Packs interpret facts.

Production Events are facts.

Forge Core must never hardcode carrier-specific, channel-specific, contest-specific, compensation-specific, career-specific, promotion-specific, KPI-specific, activity-specific or recognition-specific logic.

Canonical hierarchy:

Carrier
↓
Distribution Channel
↓
Rule Pack
↓
Rules

SMNYL Agency 2026 is the first validated Rule Pack.

SMNYL Agency 2026 is not Forge Core.

---

### Capture Once

Forge should be the primary operational source.

Do not ask a user to capture the same data twice.

If Forge can infer, import, extract or derive a reliable data point, do not request duplicate manual capture.

Excel, PDFs, institutional formats and reports are derived views or evidence, not competing systems of record.

---

### Forecast Truth Boundary

Forecasts are not facts.

Predicted income is not paid income.

Projected qualification is not confirmed qualification.

Expected production is not production.

Forecasts must remain clearly labeled as suggestions, estimates or scenarios.

---

### Economic Evidence Rule

Economic outputs require evidence, rules and confidence.

Do not show income potential, expected income or income at risk unless Forge can identify the supporting facts, Rule Pack context, RuleSnapshot, period context and confidence level.

Unknown values must remain unknown.

---

### Metric Ownership Rule

No metric without an owner.

One metric has one conceptual owner.

Other domains consume official metric outputs.

They do not recalculate or create duplicate truth.

---

## Orchestrator Rule

Orchestrators consume engines.

They do NOT duplicate logic.

---

## Offline First

Forge Core must work without AI providers.

Core engines must continue operating if:

- OpenAI fails
- Internet fails
- Cloud services fail

---

## AI Layer Principle

Forge decides.

Generative AI explains.

AI may:

- Draft messages
- Explain recommendations
- Improve language

AI may NOT:

- Invent products
- Invent premiums
- Invent coverage
- Invent recommendations

---

## Workflow

Analyze
↓
Propose
↓
Approve
↓
Implement
↓
Test
↓
Commit
↓
Push

Rules:

- No UI changes without explicit instruction
- No app.js changes without explicit instruction
- Run tests before commit
- Commit by PAQ
- Push only when requested

### Constitutional Gate for Codex

Before any Forge work starts, Codex must declare:

- Applicable Constitution
- Applicable ADRs
- Build Tree area
- Discovery status
- Implementation readiness
- Miranda approval
- Board approval status
- Scope boundary
- Prohibited surfaces
- Validation expectation

If any required gate field is missing, the task is BLOCKED BY ROBOCOP LOCK 001.

Read-only inventory may be used only to complete the gate.

Implementation, refactor, migration, repair, test creation, schema change, route change, UI change, rule change or business logic change may not begin until the Constitutional Gate is complete.

Codex must not implement discoveries or candidates marked as:

- Discovery
- Candidate
- Not Ratified
- Documentation Only
- Implementation Deferred
- Implementation Blocked
- No Implementation

Those statuses allow read-only inventory, governance mapping or approval requests only.

- Do not mix 2025 commission schedules with 2026 contest rules.
- Do not mix Prima Meta, Prima Pago, commission and renewal.
- Do not treat LIMRA and IGC as interchangeable.
- Do not ask for manual capture when Forge can infer from reliable source data.

## Advisor Experience Domain

Status:

- PLANNED
- ARCHITECTURE APPROVED
- NO IMPLEMENTED

Source:

Responsibilities:

- Advisor Setup
- Benvenù Experience
- Advisor Baseline Snapshot
- Progressive Discovery
- Clippy Engine
- Feature Learning State
- Contextual Help Signals
- Revenue Intelligence Introduction
- Command Palette Introduction
- Candy Crush Experience

Boundaries:

- Advisor Experience is not UI decoration.
- Advisor Experience is not a chatbot.
- Advisor Experience is not a corporate tutorial.
- Advisor Experience does not own Revenue Intelligence rules.
- Advisor Experience does not own Mick behavior scoring.
- Advisor Experience does not own Compensation calculations.
- Advisor Experience consumes business domains but does not duplicate their logic.

Dependencies:

- Revenue Intelligence
- Mick / Behavior Intelligence
- Compensation Intelligence
- Command OS
- Policy & Sales Operations
- Learning Intelligence
- Shared Commercial Domain

Adoption Rules:

- Forge must create value before asking for manual work.

- First experience must not look or behave like a generic CRM onboarding flow.

Learning Rules:

- Learning is measured by behavior, not screens viewed.
- Feature learning states include unseen, introduced, tried, completed_with_help, completed_without_help, learned, suppressed and needs_refresh.
- A feature should stop teaching itself when the advisor can complete the work without help.

Contextual Help Rules:

- Clippy Engine must be contextual, non-invasive and non-interruptive.
- Clippy Engine must never block work.
- Clippy Engine must never repeat irrelevant information.
- Clippy Engine must never teach a function already learned.
- Contextual help may explain, orient or reveal capabilities, but must not invent recommendations, products or financial values.

Adaptive Difficulty Rules:

- Candy Crush Experience reduces complexity when the advisor is frustrated.
- Candy Crush Experience increases challenge when the advisor progresses.
- Forge must never be so difficult that it causes abandonment or so easy that it creates complacency.

---

## Recruitment Lifecycle Domain

Conceptual Model:

RecruitIdentity
→ RecruitmentApplication[]
→ CandidateAssessment[]
→ Interview[]
→ ManagerAssignment[]
→ OfficeAssignment[]
→ PrecontractCycle[]
→ AdvisorConversion?

Principles:

- RecruitIdentity is the durable person identity.
- candidateId is not permanent identity.
- applicationId represents one attempt to enter.
- cycleId represents one precontract cycle.
- Manager and office changes are assignments or events, not overwrites.
- Each precontract cycle stores the rules snapshot used at that time.
- Historical cycles must not be recalculated with new rules except as separate analysis.
- Recruitment uses a hybrid lifecycle: current state plus critical event history.

---

## Precontract Intelligence

Precontract Lifecycle Engine:

Precontract is not a fixed 90-day rule.

It must support:

- Informal activity before key activation
- Key activation date
- Configurable official window
- Key expiration
- Key reactivation
- Multiple precontract cycles
- Accumulated lifecycle history

Rules Source:

- Organization Profile
- Office Rules Config

Do not hardcode:

- Days
- Minimum number of policies
- Minimum commission amount

Outputs:

- Contract Readiness
- Risk
- Progress
- Probability of Success
- Lifecycle Stage
- Cycle History

---

## Testing Strategy

Every engine requires:

- Unit tests
- Master tests

Preference:

Action-oriented testing.

Question:

"Does the decision make sense?"

---

## Git Rules

Never:

- Force push
- Delete user work
- Commit without approval

Always:

- Check git status
- Run relevant tests
- Commit by functional unit

---

## Known Gaps

Current Gaps:

- Schemas
- Shared Fixtures
- Global Acceptance Test
- CommonJS / ESM migration strategy
- AGENTS maintenance process

---

## Core Philosophy

Forge does not exist to generate reports.

Forge exists to generate decisions.

Final Goal:

Tell the advisor:

"Do this now.
With this client.
For this reason."

And tell the manager:

"Develop this person.
Coach this skill.
Watch this risk."
