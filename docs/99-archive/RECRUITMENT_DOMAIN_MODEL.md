# Recruitment Domain Model v1.0

Recruitment Lifecycle models the path from a durable human recruit identity to a contracted advisor.

This document defines contracts and boundaries only. It does not implement engines.

## Core Principle

Recruitment is a lifecycle, not a single pipeline.

A person may be referred more than once, evaluated by different managers, enter multiple offices, receive a key, lose a key, reactivate a key, and eventually convert to advisor or never convert. Forge must preserve that history.

## Evidence Principle

Recruitment evidence must preserve source.

Allowed evidence sources:

- `MANAGER_INPUT`
- `CANDIDATE_SELF_REPORT`
- `ACTIVITY_LOG`
- `DOCUMENT_UPLOAD`
- `AUDIO_TRANSCRIPT`
- `AI_EXTRACTION`
- `SYSTEM_CALCULATION`

Rules:

- Forge can suggest evidence.
- The manager confirms evidence before it becomes decision-grade.
- Evidence should remain auditable even when a recommendation changes.
- Never ask for manual capture if Forge can infer, extract or register the same evidence automatically from reliable source data.
- AI extraction can help structure evidence, but AI does not decide candidate advancement, selection, precontract readiness or conversion.

## Mandatory Conceptual Model

```text
RecruitIdentity
  -> RecruitmentApplication[]
      -> CandidateAssessment[]
      -> Interview[]
      -> ManagerAssignment[]
      -> OfficeAssignment[]
      -> PrecontractCycle[]
          -> RuleSnapshot
          -> Progress[]
          -> Risk[]
          -> Outcome
      -> AdvisorConversion?
```

## 1. Entities

### RecruitIdentity

Durable person identity across all attempts.

Rules:

- `recruitIdentityId` is the long-lived person identity.
- It survives rejected applications, reentries, office changes and manager changes.
- It should contain identity-safe matching fields, duplicate review status and historical summary.
- It should not be confused with `candidateId`.

### RecruitmentApplication

A specific attempt to enter the organization.

Rules:

- `applicationId` represents one attempt.
- One `RecruitIdentity` may have many applications.
- Application status tracks the current attempt, not the person forever.
- Reentry creates a new application unless organization rules say to reopen an existing one.

### CandidateAssessment

Manager decision support for candidate quality.

Rules:

- Assessment is not automatic hiring.
- Assessment must preserve hard factors and vital factors.
- Multiple assessments may exist for one application.

### Interview

Conversation or formal evaluation event.

Rules:

- Interviews belong to an application.
- Interview notes, score and risk observations should persist.
- No-show and reschedule history should not be overwritten.

### ManagerAssignment

Manager ownership event.

Rules:

- Manager changes must be assignments, not overwrite.
- Each assignment has dates, reason and owner.
- Production and coaching attribution should reference the active assignment at the time of the event.

### OfficeAssignment

Office or organization-unit ownership event.

Rules:

- Office changes must be assignments, not overwrite.
- Office assignment determines which office rules config applies.
- A candidate may move offices before or during precontract.

### PrecontractCycle

One precontract lifecycle cycle.

Rules:

- `cycleId` represents one cycle.
- A cycle may start informally before key activation.
- A cycle may include key activation, official window, expiration, reactivation and closure.
- A candidate may have multiple cycles.
- Each cycle must store a rule snapshot.

### AdvisorConversion

Conversion event from recruitment to advisor.

Rules:

- Conversion creates or links `advisorId`.
- Conversion records the source application and cycle.
- Conversion should not erase recruitment history.

## 2. Relationships

- One `RecruitIdentity` has many `RecruitmentApplication` records.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` has many `CandidateAssessment` records.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` has many interviews.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` has many manager assignments.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` has many office assignments.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` has many `PrecontractCycle` records.
- One `RecruitmentApplication` may have one `AdvisorConversion`.
- One `PrecontractCycle` has one rule snapshot and many progress/risk events.

## 5. Transitions

Application transition path:

```text
NEW
-> SCREENING
-> INTERVIEWING
-> ASSESSED
-> SELECTED
-> PRECONTRACT
-> CONVERTED
```

Alternative paths:

- Any active state may move to `ON_HOLD`.
- `ON_HOLD` may return to the previous active state.
- `SCREENING`, `INTERVIEWING`, `ASSESSED` or `SELECTED` may move to `REJECTED`.
- `REJECTED` may create a new application through reentry review.
- `PRECONTRACT` may move to `WITHDRAWN`, `REJECTED`, `ON_HOLD` or `CONVERTED`.

Precontract cycle transition path:

```text
INFORMAL
-> KEY_ACTIVE
-> OFFICIAL_WINDOW
-> READY
-> CLOSED
```

Alternative paths:

- `OFFICIAL_WINDOW -> AT_RISK`
- `AT_RISK -> OFFICIAL_WINDOW`
- `OFFICIAL_WINDOW -> KEY_EXPIRED`
- `KEY_EXPIRED -> REACTIVATED`
- `REACTIVATED -> OFFICIAL_WINDOW`
- `KEY_EXPIRED -> CLOSED`

Assignment transition path:

```text
ACTIVE -> ENDED
```

Manager or office change:

```text
ACTIVE assignment -> ENDED
new assignment -> ACTIVE
```

## 8. Organization / Office Configuration

These belong to Organization Profile or Office Rules Config:

- Official window duration
- Minimum policies
- Minimum commissions
- Currency
- Valid policy definition
- Valid commission definition
- Whether informal production counts
- Whether pre-key activity counts
- Reactivation rules
- Maximum cycles
- Cooldown before reentry
- Required interviews
- Assessment scoring weights
- Hard factor weights
- Vital factor weights
- Risk thresholds
- Conversion approval roles
- Transfer approval rules
- Do-not-recruit rules

## 9. What Forge Must Not Assume

Forge must not assume:

- `candidateId` is permanent person identity.
- One candidate has only one attempt.
- One application has only one manager.
- One application has only one office.
- Precontract starts only when a key is active.
- Precontract has one universal official window.
- Expired keys end the full relationship.
- Reactivation creates clean history.
- Historical cycles should be recalculated under new rules.
- Policy or commission thresholds are global.
- A manager change should overwrite previous ownership.
- AI can decide whether someone should be contracted.

## 10. Roadmap Of Implementation

Phase 1: Contracts and documentation

- Define `RecruitIdentity`.
- Define `RecruitmentApplication`.
- Define assignment contracts.
- Define `PrecontractCycle`.
- Define `AdvisorConversion`.
- Keep current `candidate.schema.json` and `precontract.schema.json` as compatibility contracts.
- Document key-clock timestamps and derived metrics in `PrecontractCycle`.

Phase 2: Fixtures

- Add recruitment lifecycle fixtures.
- Include duplicate, reentry, transfer, reactivation and conversion scenarios.

Phase 3: Validation tests

- Parse schemas.
- Validate fixtures against minimum fields.
- Validate lifecycle transitions with static fixtures.

Phase 4: Engines

- Candidate duplicate detection engine.
- Recruitment application state engine.
- Assignment timeline engine.
- Precontract lifecycle engine.
- Advisor conversion readiness engine.

Phase 5: Orchestration

- Recruitment lifecycle orchestrator consumes the engines.
- Manager intelligence consumes lifecycle reports.
- Forge AI Connector may explain reports but cannot change decisions.
