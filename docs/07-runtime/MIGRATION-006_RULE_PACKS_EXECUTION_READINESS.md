# MIGRATION-006 Rule Packs Execution Readiness

Status: PASS

## Verdict

Execution readiness: **PASS**

The **Rule Packs / SMNYL OS** cluster is a highly isolated set of domain engines and rule constants. The external surface area is minimal (only 2 local UI consumers) and no app shell coupling exists.

## Counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| True candidate count | 47 |
| Selected batch size | 47 |
| Ownership: Rule Packs | 42 |
| Ownership: Legacy | 2 |
| Ownership: Test | 1 |
| Ownership: Advisor OS (UI) | 2 |
| Blocked files | 0 |
| External rewrites required | 2 |

## Risk Level

**LOW**

- Engines are stateless and domain-focused.
- No impact on boot path or main shell.
- Clean cluster boundary.

## Required Validation

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
git diff --check
git status --short
```

## Readiness Notes

The missing `smnyl-concursos-config.js` target is a pre-existing condition and does not block the physical migration. The migration will preserve the current (broken) contract state without introducing new failures.
