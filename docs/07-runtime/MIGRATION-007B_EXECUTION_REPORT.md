# MIGRATION-007B Candidate / Recruitment Cluster Execution Report

Status: EXECUTED

Commit: `24862f9 Move Manager OS candidate recruitment cluster`

## Objective

Move the Candidate / Recruitment Intelligence cluster into the Manager OS recruitment domain and repair only the approved test imports and fixture paths.

This migration established `manager-os/recruitment/candidate-intelligence/` as the physical home for candidate scoring and assessment logic.

## Approved Scope

Approved engine movement:

- `candidate-assessment-engine.js`
- `candidate-hard-factors-engine.js`
- `candidate-vital-factors-engine.js`
- `candidate-coachability-engine.js`
- `candidate-market-quality-engine.js`

Approved test movement:

- `candidate-assessment-master-test.js`
- `candidate-hard-factors-master-test.js`
- `candidate-vital-factors-master-test.js`
- `candidate-coachability-master-test.js`
- `candidate-market-quality-master-test.js`

Approved path repairs:

- `manager-os/recruitment/tests/recruitment-fixture-validation-test.js`
- `manager-os/recruitment/tests/interview-evidence-fixture-test.js`

Explicit no-touch surfaces:

- `app.js`
- `comisiones.js`
- `supabase-runtime.js`
- NASH master files
- Runtime managers
- `rule-packs/smnyl/`
- `setup.sh`

## Directories Created

- `manager-os/recruitment/candidate-intelligence/`
- `manager-os/recruitment/tests/`

## Imports Modified

Only the 5 approved candidate master test imports were rewritten.

| File | Previous Import | New Import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-assessment-master-test.js` | `./candidate-assessment-engine` | `../candidate-intelligence/candidate-assessment-engine` |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-hard-factors-master-test.js` | `./candidate-hard-factors-engine` | `../candidate-intelligence/candidate-hard-factors-engine` |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-vital-factors-master-test.js` | `./candidate-vital-factors-engine` | `../candidate-intelligence/candidate-vital-factors-engine` |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-coachability-master-test.js` | `./candidate-coachability-engine` | `../candidate-intelligence/candidate-coachability-engine` |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-market-quality-master-test.js` | `./candidate-market-quality-engine` | `../candidate-intelligence/candidate-market-quality-engine` |

## Fixture Paths Repaired

Only the approved fixture path repairs were applied.

| File | Previous Path | New Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/recruitment-fixture-validation-test.js` | `__dirname/fixtures/recruitment` | `__dirname/../../../fixtures/recruitment` |
| `manager-os/recruitment/tests/interview-evidence-fixture-test.js` | `__dirname/fixtures/recruitment/evidence` | `__dirname/../../../fixtures/recruitment/evidence` |

## Validations Executed

```sh
git status --short
git diff --name-status
git diff --check
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
```

Validation results:

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- Repository migration harness: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`
- Runtime verdict: `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`

## Tests Executed

```sh
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-assessment-master-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-hard-factors-master-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-vital-factors-master-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-coachability-master-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/candidate-market-quality-master-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/recruitment-fixture-validation-test.js
node manager-os/recruitment/tests/interview-evidence-fixture-test.js
```

Focused test results:

| Test | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate assessment master test | 7 / 7 PASS |
| Candidate hard factors master test | 4 / 4 PASS |
| Candidate vital factors master test | 4 / 4 PASS |
| Candidate coachability master test | 4 / 4 PASS |
| Candidate market quality master test | 4 / 4 PASS |
| Recruitment fixture validation test | 10 / 10 PASS |
| Interview evidence fixture test | 5 / 5 PASS |

## Runtime Audit Result

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| JS files scanned | 668 |
| Imports | 199 |
| Boot blockers | 0 |
| Circular imports | 0 |
| Missing targets | 6 |
| Missing exports | 2 |
| Runtime verdict | `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS` |

No new runtime warnings were introduced by MIGRATION-007B.

## Remaining Risks

- Forge runtime remains `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`.
- The 6 missing targets and 2 missing exports are pre-existing and remain open.
- NASH-derived Manager / Team intelligence remains in root and requires a separate boundary decision.
- Runtime managers remain deliberately unmoved.
- `setup.sh` remained untracked and was not touched.

## Final Runtime State

| Runtime Signal | Final State |
| --- | ---: |
| Boot blockers | 0 |
| Circular imports | 0 |
| Missing targets | 6 |
| Missing exports | 2 |
| Verdict | `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS` |

## Next Recommended Scope

Prepare MIGRATION-007C as a read-only readiness pass before any additional movement. Primary candidates are NASH-derived manager/team intelligence or a dedicated Manager OS migration closeout.
