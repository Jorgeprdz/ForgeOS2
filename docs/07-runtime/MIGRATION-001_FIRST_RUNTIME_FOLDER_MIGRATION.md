# MIGRATION-001 First Runtime Folder Migration

Status: EXECUTED

## Scope

MIGRATION-001 executed the approved LOW_RISK physical runtime move batch only.

No route files were moved.
No app shell files were changed for this migration.
No imports were rewritten because the approved files had no detected active consumers.

## Folders Created

- `shared/`
- `advisor-os/`
- `legacy/`

`platform/` already existed before this migration.

## Files Moved

### Shared

- `design-tokens.js` -> `shared/design-tokens.js`
- `operational-colors.js` -> `shared/operational-colors.js`
- `motion-principles.js` -> `shared/motion-principles.js`
- `contact-channel.constants.js` -> `shared/contact-channel.constants.js`

### Advisor OS

- `advisor-style.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/advisor-style.constants.js`
- `first-contact-objections.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/first-contact-objections.constants.js`
- `followup-type.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/followup-type.constants.js`
- `outreach-channel.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/outreach-channel.constants.js`
- `prospect-personality.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/prospect-personality.constants.js`
- `prospect-status.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/prospect-status.constants.js`
- `referral-source.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/referral-source.constants.js`
- `sales-dna.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/sales-dna.constants.js`
- `sales-script-types.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/sales-script-types.constants.js`
- `sales-tone.constants.js` -> `advisor-os/sales-tone.constants.js`

### Platform

- `animation-engine.js` -> `platform/animation-engine.js`

### Legacy

- `semantic-navigation-engine.js` -> `legacy/semantic-navigation-engine.js`

## Import Delta

Imports rewritten: 0

Reason:

- Approved files had no detected active consumers.
- Approved files had no local imports requiring destination-relative updates.
- Validation did not prove any import rewrite was necessary.

## Root Reduction

Top-level runtime files reduced by 16.

## Validation Results

### Runtime Module Graph Audit

Command:

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
```

Result:

- `totalJsFilesScanned`: 657
- `totalImportsFound`: 199
- `staticImportsFound`: 197
- `dynamicImportsFound`: 2
- `missingTargetsCount`: 4
- `missingExportsCount`: 2
- `circularImportsCount`: 0
- `bootBlockersCount`: 0
- `executabilityVerdict`: `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`
- `confidenceScore`: 0.88

### Repository Migration Harness

Command:

```sh
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
```

Result:

- `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`
- Report files regenerated under `docs/architecture/repository/reports/`

### Diff Whitespace Check

Command:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Result:

- PASS

## Remaining Warnings

The runtime graph still reports existing non-blocking warnings:

- Missing targets: 4
- Missing exports: 2

These warnings were not introduced by moving the approved LOW_RISK batch and remain outside MIGRATION-001 scope.

## Success Criteria

- Exactly 16 files moved: PASS
- Boot blockers remain 0: PASS
- Circular imports remain 0: PASS
- No route file movement: PASS
- No app shell movement: PASS
- No import rewrites beyond moved files: PASS
- Root runtime surface visibly reduced: PASS

## Recommended Next Batch

MIGRATION-002 should target low-coupling infrastructure modules with limited consumers, after a fresh move map is approved.

Recommended candidate class:

- Platform runtime helpers
- Cache/query runtime utilities
- Guarded repository utilities
- Non-route shared utilities with explicit import rewrites

Do not move the legacy CRM shell or registered route files in MIGRATION-002.
