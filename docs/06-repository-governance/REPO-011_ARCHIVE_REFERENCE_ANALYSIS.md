# REPO-011 Archive Reference Analysis

Report ID: REPO-011
Status: DISCOVERY / CLASSIFICATION COMPLETE / NO EXECUTION

## 1. Executive Summary

REPO-011 analyzed the 25 remaining `ARCHIVE_REFERENCE` links from REPO-008 after REPO-010 executed the 96 approved SAFE auto-fixes. No files were moved, no links were rewritten, no imports were changed and no runtime files were touched.

All 25 archive references point to targets that exist under `docs/99-archive/`. The primary governance question is not existence; it is whether future rewrites should simply redirect to archive or preserve explicit historical context.

## 7. Constitutional Traceability Test

Rewriting an archive reference to its current `docs/99-archive/` path does not delete provenance by itself. The risk is semantic: a future reader may mistake an archived artifact for current doctrine if surrounding text does not identify it as historical.

- `SAFE_TO_REDIRECT`: target is an archived supporting document and direct archive path preserves traceability.
- `PRESERVE_HISTORICAL_LINK`: target or source has constitutional/foundation/superseded significance; future execution should preserve historical wording or add explicit archive context in the execution report.
- `NEEDS_DUAL_REFERENCE`: no records currently require dual links.

## 8. Execution Readiness

| Wave | Scope | Count | Execution Readiness | Rule |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| WAVE-A | Low-risk archive redirects | 21 | Ready for dry-run rewrite map | Rewrite direct archive path only; do not alter prose. |
| WAVE-B | Historical references requiring provenance language | 4 | Plan first | May rewrite path, but execution report must preserve historical/foundation context. |
| WAVE-C | Human review required | 0 | Not ready | No execution without council review. |

## 9. Recommended Next Action

Recommended REPO-012 scope: create a dry-run rewrite map for WAVE-A archive redirects only. Keep WAVE-B separate because Foundation Lock and superseded-document references carry stronger historical provenance requirements.
