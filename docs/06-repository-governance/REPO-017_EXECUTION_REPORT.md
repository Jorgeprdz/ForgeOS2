# REPO-017 Execution Report

Report ID: REPO-017
Status: EXECUTED / PROJECTION EVIDENCE ARCHIVE PLACEMENT

## Executive Summary

REPO-017 executed the approved Product Intelligence projection evidence archive placement from REPO-016.

Exactly 3 tracked root `.txt` validation reports were moved with `git mv` into:

`docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/`

Exactly 3 checkpoint links were rewritten in:

`docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md`

No additional files were moved, no imports were rewritten, no runtime files were modified and no code files were modified.

## Files Moved

| # | Source | Destination |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |
| 2 | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |
| 3 | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |

## Links Rewritten

| # | Source File | Visible Text | Old Target | New Target |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |
| 2 | `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |
| 3 | `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | `product-intelligence/projection-evidence/FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` |

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| protected_root_violation | PASS | 0 |
| runtime_move_candidate | PASS | 0 |
| inventory_schema | PASS | 0 |
| destination_overwrite_risk | PASS | 0 |
| broken_markdown_links | PASS | 0 |

Harness status: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`

The aggregate harness status still reports warnings allowed, but every hard gate is passing and `broken_markdown_links` is now `PASS | 0`.

Additional validation:

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- Runtime/code diff scan: PASS, no protected runtime assets or code/package files detected
- Move scope: PASS, exactly 3 approved tracked `.txt` reports moved

## Broken Link Impact

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Broken links before REPO-017 | 3 |
| Broken links after REPO-017 | 0 |
| Broken links reduced by | 3 |

## Remaining Broken Links

None detected by the migration harness.

## Warnings

No REPO-017-specific hard blockers remain.

The harness aggregate status may continue to display `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`, but the hard gate list shows `PASS | 0` for all required checks.

## Rollback Notes

Before commit, rollback can be performed by reversing the 3 `git mv` operations and restoring the 3 checkpoint link targets.

After commit, rollback should use a revert commit for the REPO-017 changeset.

## Recommended Commit Message

Archive projection evidence reports and fix checkpoint links
