# REPO-016 Projection Evidence Ownership Analysis

Report ID: REPO-016
Status: GOVERNED MOVE PLANNING / NO EXECUTION

## Executive Summary

REPO-016 analyzed the final 3 broken Markdown links remaining after REPO-015. All 3 originate from:

`docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md`

The broken links point to tracked `.txt` validation reports that currently live at repository root. These are not runtime assets and not repository governance reports. They are Product Intelligence projection evidence artifacts.

No files were moved, no links were rewritten, no imports were changed and no runtime files were modified.

## Current Broken Link Inventory

## Target Report Purposes

| Report | Original Purpose | Evidence Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Validated Imagina Ser extraction against a real quote, including PDF extraction, critical product fields, UDI status and validation checks. | Product quote extraction and projection evidence |
| `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Audited the projection engine against the advisor Excel model and documented the limits of universal projection logic across products. | Projection engine validation evidence |
| `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Documented the global 4.5% UDI projection validation, Banxico status and related projection engine changes. | Global projection policy validation evidence |

## Ownership Analysis

Allowed owner set:

- Constitution
- ADR
- Discovery
- Repository Governance
- Product Intelligence
- Archive
- Unknown

| Report | Constitutional Owner | Archive Custodian | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Product Intelligence | Archive | The report validates product-specific extraction and projection evidence for Imagina Ser. It supports product truth and projection interpretation, not repository mechanics. |
| `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Product Intelligence | Archive | The report validates projection behavior against product worksheet evidence and explains product-family differences. |
| `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Product Intelligence | Archive | The report documents global UDI projection validation and Banxico-backed projection policy evidence. |

## Non-Owners Rejected

| Candidate Owner | Rejection Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Constitution | The reports do not define constitutional doctrine. |
| ADR | The reports are evidence artifacts, not decision records. |
| Discovery | The reports are validation outputs from completed projection work, not open discovery reports. |
| Repository Governance | The links are surfaced by repository validation, but the content is product/projection evidence. |
| Unknown | Purpose, references and content are observable. |

## Ownership Verdict
