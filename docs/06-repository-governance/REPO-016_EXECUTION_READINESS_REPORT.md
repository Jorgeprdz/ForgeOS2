# REPO-016 Execution Readiness Report

Report ID: REPO-016
Status: EXECUTION READINESS / NO EXECUTION

## Executive Summary

REPO-016 approves the canonical archive placement for the final 3 projection validation evidence reports.

Execution readiness verdict:

`PASS`

The future REPO-017 execution should be a small governed movement batch: create the destination directory, move the 3 tracked root `.txt` reports with `git mv`, then rewrite the 3 checkpoint links to their new source-relative archive paths.

## Readiness Matrix

| Risk Area | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership conflicts | PASS | All 3 reports belong to Product Intelligence with Archive custody. |
| Destination conflicts | PASS | Proposed destination is absent and no duplicate target files were found. |
| Duplicate filename risks | PASS | Filenames are unique in repository search results. |
| Traceability risks | PASS | Filenames remain unchanged and future movement should use `git mv`. |
| Runtime risk | PASS | Files are tracked `.txt` evidence reports, not runtime/code/package files. |
| Link rewrite risk | PASS_WITH_WARNINGS | Only 3 links should be rewritten after movement; scope is narrow and observable. |

## Target Reports Identified

| # | Report | Current Location | Owner | Destination Classification |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Repository root | Product Intelligence + Archive | APPROVED |
| 2 | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Repository root | Product Intelligence + Archive | APPROVED |
| 3 | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Repository root | Product Intelligence + Archive | APPROVED |

## Approved Destination

`docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/`

This location is canonical for the remaining 3 projection validation reports because it:

- keeps historical evidence in `docs/99-archive/`;
- makes Product Intelligence ownership explicit;
- names projection evidence as the artifact class;
- avoids treating validation reports as runtime, architecture doctrine or repository governance.

## REPO-017 Recommended Scope

REPO-017 should execute one controlled batch:

1. Create `docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/`.
2. Move the 3 tracked root `.txt` reports using `git mv`.
3. Rewrite only the 3 links in `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md`.
4. Run:

```sh
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/06-repository-governance/reports
git diff --check
git diff --name-only | rg '(^app\.js$|^index\.html$|^manifest\.json$|^service-worker\.js$|^sw-cache-config\.js$|\.js$|\.ts$|\.tsx$|\.jsx$|package.*\.json$)'
```

Expected outcome:

- broken Markdown links reduce from `3` to `0`;
- hard gates remain `PASS | 0`;
- no runtime/code/package files modified.

## Execution Constraints For REPO-017

- Use `git mv` for the 3 tracked reports.
- Do not move unrelated root files.
- Do not rewrite unrelated links.
- Do not modify runtime files.
- Do not modify imports.
- Do not alter report content during movement.

## Final Verdict

`PASS`

Forge is ready for REPO-017 as a governed move-and-link-rewrite execution batch for exactly 3 projection evidence reports.

Confidence score: 0.90
