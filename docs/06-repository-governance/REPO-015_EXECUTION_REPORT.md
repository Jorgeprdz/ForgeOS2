# REPO-015 Execution Report

Report ID: REPO-015
Status: EXECUTED / WAVE-B DUAL-LINK PROVENANCE REWRITES

## Executive Summary

REPO-015 executed exactly the 4 approved `DUAL_LINK_REQUIRED` rewrites from REPO-014. The operation preserved the original visible historical artifact name, `FORGE_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`, while changing only the Markdown target path to the current archived location.

No files were moved, no imports were rewritten, no runtime files were modified and the 3 `ARCHIVE_TARGET_REQUIRED` projection evidence links were not touched.

## Provenance Policy Applied

Approved policy:

Preserve the original artifact name as visible historical text while linking to the current canonical archived location.

Applied pattern:

- Visible text preserved: `FORGE_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`
- Link target updated to the source-relative path for `docs/99-archive/FORGE_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`

## Execution Counts

## Skipped Items

The following 3 links were not modified because REPO-014 classified them as `ARCHIVE_TARGET_REQUIRED` and out of scope for REPO-015:

| Source File | Broken Target | Required Governance Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Approve archive destination for root validation report target. |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Approve archive destination for root validation report target. |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | Approve archive destination for root validation report target. |

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| protected_root_violation | PASS | 0 |
| runtime_move_candidate | PASS | 0 |
| inventory_schema | PASS | 0 |
| destination_overwrite_risk | PASS | 0 |
| broken_markdown_links | WARN | 3 |

Harness status: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`

Additional validation:

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- Runtime/code diff scan: PASS, no protected runtime assets or code/package files detected
- Rename/file move scan: PASS, no file moves detected

## Remaining Unresolved Links

| Source File | Link | Status | Governance Category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_IMAGINA_SER_REAL_QUOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | TARGET_BROKEN | ARCHIVE_TARGET_REQUIRED |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_PROJECTION_ENGINE_VS_EXCEL_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | TARGET_BROKEN | ARCHIVE_TARGET_REQUIRED |
| `docs/99-archive/FORGE_PROJECTION_INTELLIGENCE_CHECKPOINT_NOTE.md` | `FORGE_GLOBAL_UDI_PROJECTION_VALIDATION_REPORT.txt` | TARGET_BROKEN | ARCHIVE_TARGET_REQUIRED |

## Recommended REPO-016 Scope

REPO-016 should resolve the final 3 broken links by authorizing a target archival movement plan for the tracked root projection validation reports:

1. Create an explicit move map for the 3 root `.txt` validation reports.
2. Move approved targets to `docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/` using `git mv`.
3. Rewrite only the 3 checkpoint links to the new source-relative archive paths.
4. Run the migration harness check and `git diff --check`.
