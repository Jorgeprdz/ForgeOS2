## Files Skipped

No approved SAFE rewrite records were skipped. Non-SAFE REPO-008 categories remain intentionally untouched: 25 `ARCHIVE_REFERENCE`, 3 `NEEDS_MOVE`, 0 `DEAD_LINK`, 0 `HUMAN_REVIEW`.

## Validation Results

| Gate | Status | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| protected_root_violation | PASS | 0 |
| runtime_move_candidate | PASS | 0 |
| inventory_schema | PASS | 0 |
| destination_overwrite_risk | PASS | 0 |
| broken_markdown_links | WARN | 28 |

Overall harness status: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED` with exit code `0`.

Additional validation:

- `git diff --check`: passed
- Runtime/code diff scan: no `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, package JSON, `app.js`, `manifest.json` or `service-worker.js` changes detected
- Only documentation files and generated repository reports changed

## Remaining Broken Links

28 broken Markdown links remain. These correspond to non-SAFE categories from REPO-008 and should be handled by later governance waves, not by this execution batch.

## Recommended REPO-011 Scope

Prepare an archive-reference rewrite plan for the 25 `ARCHIVE_REFERENCE` links. The plan should explicitly preserve historical/archive semantics and should not mix with the 3 `NEEDS_MOVE` links until their target ownership is resolved.
