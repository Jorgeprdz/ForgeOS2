# REPO-018 Repository Migration Closure Report

Report ID: REPO-018
Status: CLOSEOUT AUDIT

## Executive Summary

The Repository Governance Initiative is technically closed for the migration, classification, validation and remediation phases covered by REPO-001 through REPO-017.

The initiative started as a folder-migration question and became an operational repository governance capability. The final state is materially stronger than the starting state:

- root is no longer treated as a generic Platform bucket;
- documentation migration is governed by ownership, not aesthetics;
- runtime and constitutional root assets remain protected;
- the migration harness exists and produces repeatable reports;
- broken Markdown links are cleared;
- destination overwrite risk is cleared;
- projection evidence now has a governed archive placement.

No Constitution changes are made by this report.

## 1. Timeline

| Phase | Scope | Major Discovery | Risk Eliminated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REPO-001 | Repository Governance Discovery | Folder structure is not architecture; decision ownership creates domain ownership. | Blocked premature physical migration. |
| REPO-002 | ADR-0020 Stress Test | Single accountable ownership survives if ownership means source-of-truth accountability, not exclusive use. | Rejected `shared/` and `legacy/` as unmanaged dumping grounds. |
| REPO-003 | Physical Migration Readiness | Safe migration requires owner registry, import visibility, dry-run, rollback and harness support. | Blocked bulk file movement without tooling. |
| REPO-004 | Root Surface Classification | Root is Runtime + Governance surface, not Platform. | Prevented unsafe migration of runtime and constitutional anchors. |
| REPO-005 | Document Migration Execution Plan | Physical cleanup had higher ROI than more discovery once root protection rules existed. | Defined waves and execution harness requirements. |
| BUILD-001 | Harness v1 Implementation | Migration needs repeatable inventory, plan, validate and rewrite-plan commands. | Replaced manual guesswork with reports. |
| BUILD-002 | Harness Validation Hardening | Broken links, duplicate destinations and inventory schema needed explicit gates. | Added regression coverage for protected root assets. |
| BUILD-003 | Harness Reporting and CI Aggregation | Repository migration needed JSON outputs, `check`, output directories and anchor validation. | Made validation repeatable and CI-style. |
| REPO-006 | Destination Overwrite Investigation | One constitutional amendment collision was a minor variation, not a safe overwrite. | Explained the only hard overwrite blocker. |
| REPO-007 | Archive Superseded Source | Root amendment conversion was archived without overwriting canonical destination. | Cleared destination overwrite risk. |
| REPO-008 | Broken Link Triage | 124 broken links split into AUTO_FIX, ARCHIVE_REFERENCE and NEEDS_MOVE. | Converted link chaos into governed remediation waves. |
| REPO-009 | AUTO_FIX Rewrite Map | 96 protected-root-anchor and low-risk links could be safely mapped. | Produced exact dry-run patch before execution. |
| REPO-010 | AUTO_FIX Execution | 96 approved safe rewrites were applied. | Reduced broken links from 124 to 28. |
| REPO-011 | Archive Reference Planning | Archive links needed traceability policy, not blind rewrites. | Split archive links into WAVE-A, WAVE-B and NEEDS_MOVE. |
| REPO-012 | WAVE-A Dry Run | 21 archive redirects were LOW_RISK. | Prepared execution-ready archive rewrite map. |
| REPO-013 | WAVE-A Execution | 21 archive redirects were applied. | Reduced broken links from 28 to 7. |
| REPO-014 | Final 7 Governance | 4 links needed historical provenance; 3 needed target archive placement. | Prevented false cleanup of historical and evidence links. |
| REPO-015 | WAVE-B Execution | Visible historical artifact names could be preserved while links point to archive. | Reduced broken links from 7 to 3. |
| REPO-016 | Projection Evidence Planning | Final 3 links were Product Intelligence evidence placement issues. | Approved canonical archive destination. |
| REPO-017 | Projection Evidence Execution | 3 root validation reports moved into Product Intelligence projection evidence archive. | Reduced broken links from 3 to 0. |

## 2. Metrics Summary

### Root Documents

| Metric | Before | After | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Root files audited | 1035 | Not re-audited in closure | REPO-004 audited root surface. |
| Root docs/reports | Approximately 341 | 22 current root `.md` / `.txt` files | REPO-005 estimate and current root scan. |
| Root documentation reduction | Baseline | Approximately 93.5% | Based on 341 to 22. |
| Protected root assets | Present | Present | `AGENTS.md`, `FORGE_CONSTITUTION_V3.md`, `FORGE_MASTER_BUILD_TREE.md` remain at root. |

Current root `.md` / `.txt` count is 22. Some current root documents remain as transitional or separately governed artifacts and are not part of this closeout's execution scope.

## 3. Major Discoveries

### Repository Governance

Problem:

The repository had grown large enough that file placement could no longer be treated as housekeeping.

Discovery:

Repository organization requires governance: owners, protected surfaces, move maps, validation gates and rollback discipline.

Impact:

Migration moved from subjective cleanup to an auditable operating capability.

### Ownership-Based Migration

Problem:

Files can serve many domains and could not be safely placed by filename or folder preference alone.

Discovery:

A file may have many consumers but must have one accountable owner for meaning, correction and source-of-truth status.

Impact:

File placement now follows decision ownership and archive custody rather than visual neatness.

### Root Surface Governance

Problem:

Root was being treated as Platform by default.

Discovery:

Root is a protected Runtime + Governance surface containing runtime entrypoints, constitutional anchors, compatibility assets and transitional artifacts.

Impact:

Runtime assets and constitutional anchors remained protected throughout migration.

### Historical Provenance Policy

Problem:

Some broken links were historical references, not ordinary path errors.

Discovery:

Historical constitutional/foundation links should preserve visible artifact names while linking to archived locations.

Impact:

Forge can repair Markdown validation without erasing historical meaning.

### Archive Domain Structure

Problem:

Archive could become a landfill if every old artifact went there without ownership.

Discovery:

Archive is custodial storage; domain ownership still applies. Projection evidence belongs to Product Intelligence with Archive custody.

Impact:

`docs/99-archive/product-intelligence/projection-evidence/` became the canonical placement for projection validation evidence.

### Migration Harness

Problem:

Manual migration planning could not reliably detect collisions, broken links, protected assets or runtime risk.

Discovery:

The migration harness must inspect, classify, validate and report, while never moving or rewriting by itself.

Impact:

Forge now has repeatable repository validation outputs and CI-ready hard gates.

## 4. Constitutional Implications

Repository Governance is not merely documentation process.

Assessment:

| Option | Verdict | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Documentation process only | Rejected | The harness, protected root rules and move governance affect operational repository safety. |
| B. Repository operational capability | Approved | Repository Governance now has tools, gates, reports, ownership rules and execution protocol. |
| C. Candidate constitutional domain | Future discovery required | It may deserve constitutional recognition if Forge keeps scaling, but current evidence supports operational capability first. |

Recommendation:

Treat Repository Governance as a repository operational capability under Architecture Governance for now. Do not modify the Constitution yet. Open a future ADR or constitutional review only after the harness is integrated into CI and root-surface policy is stable across multiple migration cycles.

## 5. Open Questions

| Question | Status | Recommended Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AGENTS.md ownership | FUTURE IMPROVEMENT | Operational Governance + Architecture Governance | Protected root asset is clear; long-term maintenance workflow remains open. |
| Root surface governance after cleanup | FUTURE IMPROVEMENT | Repository Governance | Root still has transitional docs and generated artifacts. |
| CI integration for migration harness | FUTURE IMPROVEMENT | Platform + Repository Governance | Harness exists; CI gate is not yet formalized. |
| Archive policy for future evidence artifacts | DISCOVERY REQUIRED | Archive + Domain Owners | Product Intelligence evidence policy is proven; other domains need equivalent rules. |
| Legacy zero policy | FUTURE IMPROVEMENT | Repository Governance | Legacy remains temporary quarantine by principle; periodic shrink review needed. |
| CODEOWNERS or owner registry | DISCOVERY REQUIRED | Architecture Governance | Required if contributor count grows. |
| Root generated report handling | FUTURE IMPROVEMENT | Repository Governance | Output directories help, but generated artifacts need lifecycle rules. |

## 6. Final Verdict

| Score | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Technical Success Score | 94 / 100 |
| Governance Success Score | 92 / 100 |
| Confidence Score | 0.91 |

What was accomplished:

- Repository migration was converted from a folder proposal into governed execution.
- Root document surface was reduced dramatically.
- Protected root and runtime assets remained untouched.
- Broken Markdown links were reduced from 124 to 0.
- Destination overwrite risk was eliminated.
- Projection evidence gained canonical archive placement.
- Migration Harness v1 became the validation backbone.

What remains:

- Formal CI integration.
- Owner registry or CODEOWNERS equivalent.
- Future archive policies for non-Product Intelligence evidence.
- Root surface lifecycle rules for generated and transitional documents.

Recommended next phase:

`REPO-GOVERNANCE-002: CI Integration and Owner Registry`

Scope:

1. Add migration harness `check` to a repeatable CI or pre-commit validation path.
2. Create a lightweight owner registry for protected root, archive custody and domain evidence artifacts.
3. Define lifecycle rules for generated reports.
4. Create a root-surface review cadence.
