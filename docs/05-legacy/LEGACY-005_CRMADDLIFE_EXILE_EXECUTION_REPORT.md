## Recommended Next Scope

Recommended next scope:

1. Plan a dedicated `EXILE_WITH_IMPORT_REWRITE` batch for:
   - `route-transition-manager.js`
   - `dashboard-executive.js`
   - `concursos.js`
2. Or proceed with the deferred Policy Operations cartera service dependency batch.

Do not move boot-path files or active route files until the legacy shell replacement strategy is approved.
