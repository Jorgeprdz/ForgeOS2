## Constitutional Gate

Applicable Constitution:

- FORGE_CONSTITUTION_V3.md
- Evidence precedes judgment.
- Precision > speed.
- Trust > features.
- Governance before execution.
- Build Tree status must reflect evidence, not intention.

Applicable ADRs:

- ADR-001 Evidence Ownership / Source Validity
- ADR-002 One Metric One Owner
- ADR-003 Recommendation vs Decision Authority Boundary
- ADR-004 No Invented Recommendations

Build Tree area:

- FORGE_MASTER_BUILD_TREE.md
- Governance / ROBOCOP
- Test / Runtime Integrity
- Platform & Operations
- Build Tree status evidence

Discovery status:

- Implementation ready for documentation/evidence reconciliation only.
- No feature implementation allowed.
- No discovery implementation allowed.

Implementation readiness:

- Approved for documentation reconciliation only.
- Not approved for engines, product logic, schemas, routes, UI, package normalization, or architecture refactor.

Miranda approval:

- Conditional approval.
- Approved only for conservative, evidence-backed status reconciliation.
- Blocked for any feature status upgrade based only on intention.

Board approval status:

- No Board escalation required for this documentation-only reconciliation.
- Board review is required before any status change that implies new implementation authority, domain ownership, metric ownership, source ownership, or product/financial truth.

Operator-provided current evidence:

- TRUST LOCK 001A completed inventory.
- TRUST LOCK 001B passed.
- Base test suite current result: PASS.
- real-pdf-ocr-test.js is an explicit SKIP when no local fixture exists.

## Executive Summary

- ROBOCOP LOCK 001 is LOCKED in governance documentation.
- The mandatory Constitutional Gate is active in AGENTS.md and governance docs.
- Runtime/Test Integrity has moved from needs validation first to validated baseline / needs ongoing hardening.
- Current runtime evidence reports EXECUTABLE with 0 boot blockers, 0 missing targets, 0 missing exports, and 0 cycles.
- TRUST LOCK 001B is accepted as current operational evidence from the task context, but no dedicated TRUST LOCK 001B artifact was found during this reconciliation.
- real PDF OCR remains manual/local until a versioned fixture or release-safe evidence packet exists.
- Nodes marked Discovery, Candidate, Not Ratified, Documentation Only, Implementation Deferred, Implementation Blocked, No Implementation, or equivalent remain non-implementable.
- No feature node should be marked complete from this reconciliation alone.

## Required Build Tree Interpretation

Runtime/Test Integrity is now a validated baseline, not an open blocker for documentation planning.

This does not mean Forge is feature-complete.

This does not authorize:

- feature implementation
- discovery implementation
- Product Intelligence expansion
- Manager OS visibility expansion
- UI work
- schema work
- route work
- package normalization
- business logic changes
- commercial rule changes

## Nodes That Remain Blocked Or Non-Implementable

| Node | Reason | Required prior step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Russell | Discovery Candidate | Ratification or explicit Board decision |
| GMM Coverage Intelligence implementation | BUILD_TREE_UPDATE_REPORT keeps implementation blocked pending real evidence | Complete real evidence packets and validation protocol |
| Candidate Document Classification | Discovery validated / not implemented | Readiness document and approved implementation scope |
| Quote-to-Policy Comparison | Parked / validation candidate | Validation plan and evidence fixtures |
| Proposal Intelligence | Parked / core candidate / do not implement yet | Governance closure and evidence-backed scope |
| Universal Command OS | Planned/conceptual only | ADR and implementation readiness |
| Career OS Transition | Planned/conceptual only | Career OS governance and migration readiness |
| Organization Health | Planned/discovery | Manager OS readiness and signal ownership |
| Leadership Intelligence | Planned/discovery | Manager OS governance and evidence model |
| Partner Intelligence | Planned/discovery | Board owner/veto and source model |
| Offline First & Sync | Planned | Sync contract, conflict model, and validation plan |
| Compensation formulas or payouts | Rule Pack/source separation required | Rule Pack governance, RuleSnapshot evidence, source documents |
| Forecast financial outputs | Forecasts are not facts | Explicit data, rate/source validation, confidence model |
| real PDF OCR release test | Local/manual fixture only | Versioned fixture or manual-test classification |

## Nodes Ready For Next Sprint

These nodes are ready only for constrained, evidence-first work:

1. Truth Boundary / Source Governance
   - Reason: runtime/test baseline no longer blocks source truth hardening.
   - Allowed next work: source ownership, evidence state vocabulary, provenance checks, no feature expansion.

2. Runtime/Test Integrity hardening
   - Reason: current baseline is clean.
   - Allowed next work: preserve baseline, persist Trust Lock evidence, classify manual/local tests.

3. Build Tree status patch
   - Reason: the root Build Tree does not explicitly expose Governance / ROBOCOP or Test / Runtime Integrity as status nodes.
   - Allowed next work: minimal documentation patch only, if approved.

4. Product/Policy truth boundary validation
   - Reason: GMM and forecast nodes need evidence discipline before implementation.
   - Allowed next work: validation protocol, source registry, fixture strategy.

## Recommended Next Sprint

TRUTH BOUNDARY 001 should be the next sprint after this reconciliation.

Objective:

- Establish or verify the source/evidence ownership layer needed before any Product Intelligence, Forecast Intelligence, Compensation Intelligence, or GMM implementation expansion.

Why this is next:

- ROBOCOP governance is locked.
- Runtime/Test Integrity is a validated baseline.
- The remaining high-risk Build Tree nodes are blocked mainly by truth/source/evidence boundaries, not by boot blockers.
- Miranda approval is most likely for work that reduces false confidence and prevents invented truth.

Allowed next sprint scope:

- Source ownership documentation or registry verification.
- Evidence state vocabulary validation.
- Fixture/manual-test classification.
- Truth boundary reports.
- No feature implementation unless a separate gate proves readiness.

## Recommended Root Build Tree Treatment

Do not mark any feature node complete from this reconciliation alone.

Recommended future minimal Build Tree patch, if requested:

- Add or annotate Governance / ROBOCOP as LOCKED.
- Add or annotate Test / Runtime Integrity as Validated Baseline / Ongoing Hardening.
- Add a note that local/manual OCR remains outside release confidence until fixture evidence is versioned.
- Preserve all discovery/candidate/planned nodes as non-implementable.

## Verification Resolution

The previous `PASS WITH PATCHES` verdict was conservative.

No unresolved patch is required inside this reconciliation report.

The only patch identified is a future optional root Build Tree annotation, which is explicitly outside this report's modification scope unless separately approved.

This report already contains the required evidence-backed status statements:

- ROBOCOP LOCK 001: LOCKED
- TRUST LOCK 001B: PASS
- Runtime/Test Integrity: validated baseline / needs ongoing hardening
- real PDF OCR: manual/local until versioned fixture exists
- Discovery, Candidate, Blocked, Deferred and No Implementation nodes remain non-implementable
- Next sprint recommendation: READY FOR TRUTH BOUNDARY 001

## Final Status

PASS

READY FOR TRUTH BOUNDARY 001
