# Partner Compensation Bonus Coverage 001

Status: PARTNER-COMP-BONUS-COVERAGE-001B/C LOCK

Date: 2026-06-27

Scope:

- Documentation/test-only PCV 2026 Partner bonus coverage lock.
- No calculators, orchestrators, rule-data, fixtures, runtime, UI, schemas, payout truth semantics or ownership source truth gates changed.
- This document records repo-real implementation status from `PARTNER-COMP-BONUS-COVERAGE-001A`.

## Critical Boundaries

- `candidateAmount` is not `payoutTruth`.
- `payoutTruth=true` requires official confirmed evidence and statement/account line match.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Semantic amount is not full `candidateAmount`.
- Raw activity logs are insufficient without paid-applied evidence.
- Ownership source truth gate remains protected.

## Repo-Real Coverage Matrix

| PCV Concept | Rule-data concept | Repo-real status | Candidate amount now | Payout truth now | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bono de Transicion | `transition-bonus` | PARTIAL | No | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Transition candidate calculator/orchestrator/test coverage. |
| Bono de Productividad Base | `productivity-base` | IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE | Yes | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Official statement ingestion and statement line match. |
| Multiplicador de Productividad | `productivity-multiplier` | IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE | Yes, when evidence is not blocked | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Official statement ingestion and longitudinal qualified-advisor/training evidence hardening. |
| Bono Adicional Anual de Productividad | `productivity-annual-additional-bonus` | PARTIAL | No repo-real calculator today | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Annual additional productivity bonus calculator/orchestrator/test coverage. |
| Bono de Produccion | `production-bonus` | IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE | Yes | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Official economic output source adapter and statement line match. |

| Bono de Alta Partner | `partner-promotion-bonus` | PARTIAL | No full candidate; semantic schedule only | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Alta Partner promotion monthly schedule/support-gate calculator/orchestrator/test coverage. |
| Bono de Conexion | `connection-bonus` | IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE | Yes, when monthly evidence and ownership pass | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Official statement ingestion and registry/full-calc caution reconciliation. |
| Bono de Desarrollo | `development-bonus` | IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE | Yes, when monthly evidence and ownership pass | BLOCKED_BY_OFFICIAL_EVIDENCE | Official statement ingestion and month-12/additional evidence hardening. |

## Implemented Candidate Concepts

- Bono de Productividad Base
- Multiplicador de Productividad
- Bono de Produccion
- Bono de Actividad
- Bono de Conexion
- Bono de Desarrollo

These concepts can calculate candidate amounts with structured evidence and `payoutTruth=false`.

## Partial Concepts

- Bono de Transicion
- Bono Adicional Anual de Productividad
- Bono de Alta Partner
- Apoyos

These concepts are represented in rule-data, but repo-real implementation remains partial because at least one calculator, orchestrator, regression test, support table reconciliation, longitudinal evidence path or full candidate boundary is missing.

## Missing Concepts

No PCV 2026 Partner concept is completely absent from official rule-data.

## Candidate Completeness Gaps

1. Transition candidate calculator/orchestrator/test coverage.
2. Annual additional productivity bonus calculator/orchestrator/test coverage.
3. Alta Partner promotion monthly schedule/support-gate calculator/orchestrator/test coverage.
4. Apoyos support table / proportional payment / recovery reconciliation.
5. Official statement/account ingestion after candidate completeness.

## Payout Truth Lock

All PCV Partner bonuses remain blocked for `payoutTruth=true` until Forge has official statement/account ingestion, official confirmed evidence and statement/account line match.

Candidate calculations, semantic amounts, OCR/PDF/AI extraction, high confidence matching, raw activity logs and manually entered projections do not establish payout truth.

## Partner Compensation Closure Correction — Status Truth

Partner Compensation overall is **PARTIAL / ACTIVE WORKSTREAM**.

The **Partner Compensation Candidate Foundation Subset** is **IMPLEMENTED_CANDIDATE / SUBSET STABILIZED**.

Full candidate completeness is **NOT CLOSED**.
