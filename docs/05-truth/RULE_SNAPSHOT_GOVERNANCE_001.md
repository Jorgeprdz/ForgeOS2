## Executive Summary

Forge thinks. AI interprets.

AI SHALL NOT OVERRIDE FORGE.

This governance contract defines how a commercial, product, compensation, contest, career, forecast-assumption, conservation or carrier rule can become a valid RuleSnapshot without contaminating Forge Core.

RuleSnapshot governance exists to prevent silent hardcoding, undocumented business logic, stale rules, invented compensation and false product truth.

This document is not a Rule Pack implementation. It does not create rules, loaders, validators, engines, schemas or runtime behavior.

## RuleSnapshot Definition

A RuleSnapshot is a versioned, source-backed, effective-period-bound rule set.

A valid RuleSnapshot represents a frozen rule interpretation for a defined domain, owner, source, version, period, jurisdiction, currency/unit context and allowed use.

A RuleSnapshot must not be:

- an assumption
- a forecast
- an AI interpretation
- OCR output
- parser output
- user memory
- local fixture
- hardcoded value
- discovery document
- undocumented business logic

## Allowed Sources For RuleSnapshot Creation

- official_document
- carrier_document
- policy_document
- quote_document, only where appropriate and not as general product rule
- governance_decision
- validated rule_pack
- validated rule_snapshot
- official external API, only with provenance

Allowed sources must carry source owner, provenance, effective period, evidenceState VALIDATED/OFFICIAL and audit trail.

## Prohibited Sources For RuleSnapshot Creation

- AI_interpretation
- OCR_output
- parser_output
- local_fixture
- hardcoded_value
- user_input without validation
- spreadsheet without owner/provenance
- discovery_doc
- forecast
- assumption
- memory
- undocumented business logic

Prohibited sources may support research, extraction candidates, discovery notes or audit questions. They cannot create executable rules.

## Allowed Transitions

| Transition | Required validation | Allowed output | Required audit event | Blocked if |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SOURCE_TRUTH -> RULE_SNAPSHOT | Source owner, effective period, Rule Pack boundary and conflict validation | RuleSnapshot | rule_snapshot_created_from_source_truth | Source lacks owner/version/effective period |
| official_document -> RULE_SNAPSHOT | Official source check and scope validation | RuleSnapshot | official_rule_snapshot_created | Official document does not govern the rule claim |
| carrier_document -> RULE_SNAPSHOT | Carrier/source/version/product/channel validation | RuleSnapshot | carrier_rule_snapshot_created | Carrier source is ambiguous, stale or unsupported |
| policy_document -> POLICY_RULE_SNAPSHOT | Policy identity, event/state and period validation | Policy-scoped RuleSnapshot | policy_rule_snapshot_created | Policy source is used as general product rule |
| rule_pack -> RULE_SNAPSHOT | Rule Pack governance approval and source traceability | RuleSnapshot | rule_snapshot_created_from_rule_pack | Rule Pack lacks source docs or effective period |
| RULE_SNAPSHOT -> RULE_ENGINE_INPUT | Active snapshot, VALIDATED/OFFICIAL state, period match and consuming domain approval | Rule engine input | rule_snapshot_released_to_engine | Runtime/engine implementation is not separately approved |
| RULE_SNAPSHOT -> DEPRECATED | Replacement, expiry, supersession or governance decision | Deprecated RuleSnapshot | rule_snapshot_deprecated | Prior version is erased or hidden |
| DEPRECATED -> BLOCKED | Current use attempt or unsafe historical use | BLOCKED | deprecated_snapshot_blocked | Deprecated snapshot is used as current rule |
| RULE_SNAPSHOT -> replacement RULE_SNAPSHOT only with audit trail | New source/version/effective period and replacement relationship | Replacement RuleSnapshot | rule_snapshot_replaced | Replacement breaks historical traceability |

## Blocked Transitions

- HARD_CODED_VALUE -> RULE is blocked because rules require source, owner, effective period and governance.
- HARD_CODED_VALUE -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because Hardcoded values cannot own rules.
- AI_INTERPRETATION -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because AI output is not source truth.
- OCR_OUTPUT -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because OCR is extraction evidence, not rule authority.
- PARSER_OUTPUT -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because parser output is candidate extraction, not source truth.
- FORECAST -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because Forecast is never fact.
- ASSUMPTION -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because assumptions are planning context, not rules.
- DISCOVERY_DOC -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because Discovery does not authorize implementation.
- LOCAL_FIXTURE -> RULE_SNAPSHOT is blocked because local fixtures are not release truth.
- USER_INPUT -> RULE_SNAPSHOT without validation is blocked because user input must be validated against source authority.
- STALE_SOURCE -> ACTIVE_RULE_SNAPSHOT without review is blocked because expired or stale evidence cannot drive current rules silently.
- CONFLICTING_SOURCE -> RULE_SNAPSHOT without reconciliation is blocked because conflict must be resolved before executable rule creation.

## Effective-Date Rules

- Every RuleSnapshot must have effectiveFrom.
- effectiveTo may be null only if the source explicitly supports current validity.
- Unknown effective dates block executable use.
- Expired snapshots cannot drive active recommendations without disclosure.
- Future snapshots cannot be treated as current rules.
- Overlapping snapshots require conflict resolution.
- RuleSnapshot changes must preserve prior versions.
- Effective period must match carrier, channel, jurisdiction, product, currency and unit context where those dimensions affect the rule.
- Historical calculations must use the RuleSnapshot active for the historical period unless an explicitly separate analysis says otherwise.

## Rule Pack Relationship

- Rule Pack is a grouped collection of RuleSnapshots.
- Forge Core must not contain carrier/distribution-specific business rules.
- Rule Packs may be carrier-specific, product-specific, jurisdiction-specific, channel-specific or period-specific.
- Rule Packs must cite source documents and effective periods.
- Rule Packs cannot override Constitution or ADRs.
- Rule Packs cannot authorize unethical or non-client-first behavior.
- SMNYL-specific rules must live in Rule Packs, not Forge Core.
- Rule Packs interpret facts; they do not create facts.
- Rule Packs may consume Product Truth, Policy Truth, Production Events, Evidence Packets and source-owned metrics, but must not redefine their owners.

## Compensation Intelligence Implications

- Compensation owner must be rule_pack/rule_snapshot, not Forge Core.
- Compensation calculations require active validated RuleSnapshot.
- Hardcoded values remain BLOCKED for compensation.
- Income projections require explicit assumptions and cannot become official metrics.
- Economic motivation cannot override client-first boundaries.
- Compensation rules must cite source, period, currency, units, metric owner and Rule Pack version.
- Compensation must not mix periods, carriers, channels, commission schedules, contest rules or manager compensation rules unless a validated RuleSnapshot explicitly allows the composition.

## Product Intelligence Implications

- Product rules require official product documents or validated carrier documents.
- OCR/parser may produce extraction candidates, not product rules.
- UDI, premiums, benefits, yields, rates, coverage and medical expense rules cannot become executable without RuleSnapshot.
- GMM/Alfa Medical rules must cite source and effective period before expansion.
- Product Knowledge Library does not automatically create Product Truth or executable rules.
- Product Intelligence may consume RuleSnapshots only when product, carrier, version, jurisdiction, currency, units and effective period match the requested claim.

## Forecast Implications

- Forecast assumptions may be documented separately, but forecast is never fact.
- Forecast assumption rules must disclose assumptions, source and uncertainty.
- Forecast outputs are DECISION_SUPPORT, not official metrics.
- Forecast cannot create RuleSnapshots for product, compensation, contest, career, conservation or policy rules.
- Forecast may consume RuleSnapshots for scenario constraints only when the snapshot is active, validated and disclosed.

## Alfred / Orchestrator Implications

- Alfred cannot execute rule-based commands from AI output.
- Alfred command authority rules require RuleSnapshot only where command behavior depends on governance rules.
- Orchestrator may consume only active, validated RuleSnapshots.
- Orchestrator must block expired, conflicting, unknown-owner or stale snapshots unless explicitly allowed as disclosed decision support.
- Alfred must not bypass Forge, RuleSnapshot validation, permission boundaries or Miranda approval.
- Orchestrator must preserve effectiveFrom, effectiveTo, source owner, evidenceState, prohibitedUses and audit trail when passing rules downstream.

## Manager OS / Advisor OS Implications

- Manager OS may consume governed RuleSnapshots for visibility, allocation and coaching boundaries.
- Manager OS cannot create human value judgments from rules.
- Advisor OS must not receive Manager OS judgments or RODI-style allocation rules.
- Miranda Wall remains active.
- Manager OS allocation, compensation, career and coaching rules must remain governed and source-backed.
- Advisor OS may receive safe actionable recommendations only when RuleSnapshot use is valid for Advisor OS visibility and does not leak Manager OS judgment.

## RuleSnapshot Validation Checklist

Before a RuleSnapshot can be considered valid, the record must answer:

- What is the source owner?
- What source document or official source supports the rule?
- What version/date/hash or evidence reference freezes the source?
- What domain owns the rule interpretation?
- What Rule Pack owns the grouped rule context?
- What effectiveFrom and effectiveTo define applicability?
- What carrier, product, channel, jurisdiction, currency and units apply?
- What ADRs and constitutional principles constrain the rule?
- What Board boundary applies?
- Does Miranda approval apply?
- What uses are allowed?
- What uses are prohibited?
- What mutation authority is allowed?
- What audit trail proves creation, validation, deprecation or replacement?

If any required answer is missing, the RuleSnapshot is BLOCKED.

## Recommended next sprint

Recommended next sprint: TRUTH BOUNDARY 003 - Validator Readiness Plan.

Rationale:

- Truth Boundary 001 defined categories and authority order.
- Truth Boundary 002 defined the TruthEnvelope contract.
- Source Ownership Registry 001 defined owners and precedence.
- Evidence State Contract 001 defined validation states.
- Rule Snapshot Governance 001 defines effective rule truth and Rule Pack boundaries.
- A validator readiness plan is now the conservative next step before implementation of validators, Rule Pack loaders, Alfred authority, Product Intelligence expansion, Forecast implementation or Compensation implementation.

## Final Status

Recommendation: READY FOR RULE SNAPSHOT GOVERNANCE LOCK.

Miranda approval: yes, documentation-only and boundary-strengthening.

Implementation authority: none.

Runtime authority: none.
