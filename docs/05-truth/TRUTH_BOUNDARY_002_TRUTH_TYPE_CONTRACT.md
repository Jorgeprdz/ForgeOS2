## Executive Summary

Forge thinks. AI interprets.

AI SHALL NOT OVERRIDE FORGE.

This contract defines the minimum documentation-level structure for future truth types, validators, guards, schemas or runtime helpers.

This document is not executable code and does not approve implementation.

## Canonical TruthEnvelope

TruthEnvelope is the canonical conceptual container for any Forge truth-bearing, evidence-bearing, recommendation-bearing, decision-support or AI-candidate output.

## EvidenceState Compatibility By Truth Type

| truthType | Compatible evidenceState | Contract notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

| RULE_SNAPSHOT | VALIDATED, OFFICIAL, DEPRECATED | DEPRECATED is historical only. |
| PRODUCT_TRUTH | VALIDATED, OFFICIAL, STALE, DEPRECATED | STALE/DEPRECATED cannot support current claims. |
| POLICY_TRUTH | VALIDATED, OFFICIAL, STALE, DEPRECATED | STALE/DEPRECATED require warning and block current strong claims. |

## Transition Rule Contract

Every transition statement must include:

- Required input truthType
- Required evidenceState
- Required validation
- Allowed output truthType
- Required audit event
- Blocked if

| Transition | Required input truthType | Required evidenceState | Required validation | Allowed output truthType | Required audit event | Blocked if |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RAW_EVIDENCE -> EVIDENCE_PACKET | RAW_EVIDENCE | UNVERIFIED, MANUAL, OFFICIAL | provenance_capture and owner_candidate_assignment | EVIDENCE_PACKET | evidence_packaged | source missing, owner impossible, prohibited source |
| EVIDENCE_PACKET -> FACT | EVIDENCE_PACKET | VALIDATED or OFFICIAL | owner, freshness, conflict, period and ADR validation | FACT | fact_validated | unknown owner, conflict unresolved, stale for current claim |
| OFFICIAL_DOCUMENT/SOURCE_TRUTH -> RULE_SNAPSHOT | SOURCE_TRUTH or EVIDENCE_PACKET from official document | OFFICIAL or VALIDATED | source owner, effective period, Rule Pack boundary | RULE_SNAPSHOT | rule_snapshot_created | hardcoded value, missing period, wrong Rule Pack |
| RULE_SNAPSHOT -> RULE_ENGINE_INPUT | RULE_SNAPSHOT | VALIDATED or OFFICIAL | consuming engine/domain approved and period matches | RULE_ENGINE_INPUT | rule_input_released | engine not approved, stale snapshot, wrong period |
| AI_EXTRACTION_CANDIDATE -> FACT | AI_EXTRACTION_CANDIDATE | EXTRACTED | Forge validation against source evidence and owner acceptance | FACT | ai_candidate_validated_to_fact | source absent, extraction conflict, owner rejection |
| AI_CLASSIFICATION_CANDIDATE -> RECOMMENDATION_INPUT | AI_CLASSIFICATION_CANDIDATE | EXTRACTED | Forge validation as advisory context only | RECOMMENDATION_INPUT | ai_classification_validated_for_input | classification implies client intent, human worth or source truth |
| FORECAST -> DECISION_SUPPORT | FORECAST | VALIDATED | assumptions, source inputs, horizon and uncertainty disclosed | DECISION_SUPPORT | forecast_released_as_decision_support | forecast_as_fact, hidden assumptions, stale inputs |
| RECOMMENDATION -> HUMAN_DECISION | RECOMMENDATION | VALIDATED | user authority and explicit confirmation | HUMAN_DECISION | human_decision_confirmed | autonomous decision, no confirmation, authority mismatch |

Notes:

- RULE_ENGINE_INPUT and RECOMMENDATION_INPUT are transition outputs for future implementation planning. They are not approved runtime types by this document.
- Any future implementation must decide whether these are aliases, helper inputs or separate types through a separate approved scope.

## Blocked Transition Contract

| Blocked transition | Contract block statement |
| --- | --- |
| AI_INTERPRETATION -> FACT | Blocked. AI output is never source truth. It cannot validate itself or become fact without a separate source/evidence transition. |
| AI_INTERPRETATION -> SOURCE_TRUTH | Blocked. Source truth requires official source/provenance, owner and domain validation. |
| FORECAST -> FACT | Blocked. Forecast must never be FACT. |
| ASSUMPTION -> FACT | Blocked. Assumptions remain scenario inputs until independently validated by evidence. |
| USER_INPUT -> SOURCE_TRUTH without validation | Blocked. User input requires authority, provenance and owner validation before any higher truth claim. |
| HARD_CODED_VALUE -> RULE | Blocked. Rules require cited source, owner, effective period and Rule Pack or governance authority. |
| DISCOVERY_DOC -> IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH | Blocked. Discovery does not authorize implementation. |
| MANAGER_SIGNAL -> ADVISOR_OS_JUDGMENT | Blocked. Manager signals may support governed Manager OS context, not Advisor OS judgment. |
| PRODUCT_PDF_AMBIGUITY -> PRODUCT_TRUTH | Blocked. Ambiguous product evidence must remain UNKNOWN, UNVERIFIED, CONFLICTING or BLOCKED. |
| LOCAL_FIXTURE -> RELEASE_TRUTH | Blocked. Local fixtures support local/manual validation only, not release truth. |

## AI Involvement Rules

- aiInvolvement must be declared.
- AI output is never source truth.
- AI may extract, classify, summarize, explain or draft.
- AI may not decide.
- AI may not mutate state.
- AI may not certify truth.
- AI may not approve governance.
- AI may not judge human worth, potential, loyalty, discipline, coachability or future success.
- AI may not create official metrics.
- AI may not override Forge.
- Forge validates before action.
- AI_INTERPRETATION_VALIDATED_FOR_PRESENTATION means the output is safe to show or explain; it does not mean the output is factually true.

## Alfred Contract Implications

- Alfred search index may index only allowed truthTypes.
- Alfred ranking must be based on Forge signals, not LLM guess.
- Alfred result cards must show truthType/evidence state where relevant.
- Alfred actions must obey mutationAuthority.
- Alfred must not bypass Forge.
- Slash search examples:
  - `/Carlos` returns indexed entities with context, not AI guesses.
  - A Carlos result may include `truthType: FACT` for validated entity identity and `evidenceState: VALIDATED`.
  - A summary line may include `truthType: AI_INTERPRETATION` only if labeled as interpretation and validated for presentation.
- Alfred may draft text, but any action with state mutation requires user confirmation and mutationAuthority other than none or blocked.
- Alfred must show UNKNOWN, STALE, CONFLICTING or BLOCKED states instead of smoothing them away.

## Orchestrator Contract Implications

- Orchestrator may consume FACT, SOURCE_TRUTH, RULE_SNAPSHOT, PRODUCT_TRUTH, POLICY_TRUTH, RECOMMENDATION, DECISION_SUPPORT and validated candidates only.
- Orchestrator must downgrade or block unsupported AI_INTERPRETATION.
- Orchestrator must preserve unknowns and assumptions.
- Orchestrator must not treat forecast, assumption, AI output, local fixture, discovery doc or hardcoded value as truth.
- Orchestrator must pass relatedADR, owner, evidenceState, validationStatus and prohibitedUses forward to downstream domains.
- Orchestrator must block outputs when prohibitedUses conflicts with the requested action.

## Manager OS / Advisor OS Implications

- Manager judgments must not leak into Advisor OS.
- Manager signals must be governed, evidence-backed and not human value judgments.
- Advisor OS may receive safe actionable recommendations, not RODI or human capital judgments.
- Manager OS visibility requires visibilityScope manager_os or advisor_and_manager and must respect boardBoundary Andrey/Patch Adams/Miranda as applicable.
- Advisor OS visibility must not expose manager_judgment, advisor_os_judgment, human worth labels or hidden pressure.
- AI cannot classify an advisor, candidate, client or manager as high value, low value, loyal, disloyal, worthy or unworthy.

## What This Contract Does NOT Authorize

This contract does not authorize:

- no runtime implementation
- no schema implementation
- no type file creation
- no validators
- no engines
- no Alfred implementation
- no DB indexing
- no Product Intelligence expansion
- no Forecast implementation
- no Compensation implementation
- no Manager OS expansion
- no UI work
- no routes
- no Supabase functions
- no tests
- no package changes
- no Build Tree status changes
- no ADR edits
- no discovery doc edits
- no git add
- no git commit
- no git push

## Recommended Next Sprint

Recommended next sprint:

SOURCE OWNERSHIP REGISTRY 001

Reason:

- The contract depends first on owner, source and claim ownership.
- Evidence State and validators should not be implemented before ownership is explicit.
- This is the most conservative next step and aligns with prior readiness 001A-001F.

Alternative planning-only follow-ups:

- EVIDENCE STATE CONTRACT 001
- RULE SNAPSHOT GOVERNANCE 001
- TRUTH BOUNDARY 003 - Validator Readiness Plan

## Final Status
