Scope: Governance documentation only for Banxico market data ownership, provider boundaries, cache ownership, fixture limits, forecast limits and AI interpretation limits.

Implementation: None

Code authority: None

Date: 2026-06-18

## Constitutional Gate

Applicable Constitution:

- AGENTS.md: no secrets in source code, no invented financial values, forecasts are not facts, AI output is never source truth, no metric without an owner.
- FORGE_CONSTITUTION_V3.md: evidence precedes judgment, no invented truth, source truth must remain owned.
- docs/00-governance/FORGE_ROBOCOP_DIRECTIVES.md: ROBOCOP LOCK 001 requires governance declaration before work.

Applicable ADRs and contracts:

- ADR-001 Evidence Ownership / Source Validity.
- ADR-002 One Metric One Owner.
- ADR-003 Recommendation vs Decision / Authority Boundary.
- ADR-004 No Invented Recommendations.
- ADR-007 Forecast Truth Boundary.
- ADR-008 Economic Evidence Boundary.
- ADR-017 Compensation Intelligence Evidence Boundary.
- TRUTH_BOUNDARY_001_SOURCE_TRUTH_AND_EVIDENCE_STATE.
- TRUTH_BOUNDARY_002_TRUTH_TYPE_CONTRACT.
- TRUTH_BOUNDARY_003_VALIDATOR_READINESS_PLAN.
- RULE_SNAPSHOT_GOVERNANCE_001.

Build Tree area:

- Truth Boundary / Source Ownership / Market Data governance documentation.

Discovery status:

- Implementation ready for documentation-only registry.
- Prior locks confirmed by repository history:
  - 19e3535 Audit Banxico rate source truth.
  - ca44b2a Remove hardcoded Banxico token.
  - 8dcd5eb Add Supabase Banxico Edge provider routing.

Implementation readiness:

- Ready for governance documentation only.
- No runtime, provider, cache, test, schema, route, UI, ADR, Build Tree or package implementation is authorized by this registry.

Miranda approval:

- Approved for disciplined source ownership documentation that prevents false confidence, token exposure and source-truth confusion.

Board approval status:

- Not required for documentation-only recording of existing market-data ownership boundaries.

## Purpose

This registry prevents Forge from confusing source truth, provider behavior, cache copies, fixtures, forecasts and AI interpretation.

Banxico SIE API owns the current UDI_MXN and USD_MXN_FIX source truth. Forge providers may fetch, adapt, cache, validate, consume or explain those values, but they do not become the institutional source truth.

## Current Runtime Routing

Current architecture:

```text
Banxico SIE API
-> Supabase Edge Function banxico-rates
-> shared-banxico-edge-provider.js
-> exchange-rate-cache-engine.js
-> engines consuming UDI/USD
```

Configured routing:

- If `SUPABASE_BANXICO_RATES_URL` exists, `exchange-rate-cache-engine.js` uses `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js`.
- If `SUPABASE_BANXICO_RATES_URL` does not exist, `exchange-rate-cache-engine.js` falls back to `shared-banxico-rate-engine.js`.
- `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js` may read `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` when present.
- `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js` must not read `BANXICO_TOKEN`.
- `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js` must not send `Bmx-Token`.
- `BANXICO_TOKEN` may be used only in backend/local direct provider fallback or as a Supabase Edge Function secret, never in frontend, client code, logs, fixtures or repo source.

Known current-rate series:

| Market data key | Banxico SIE series | Source | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UDI_MXN | SP68257 | BANXICO_SIE_API | LATEST_VERIFIED |
| USD_MXN_FIX | SF43718 | BANXICO_SIE_API | LATEST_VERIFIED |

## Ownership Table

| Data / Component | Owner | Truth category | Evidence state | Allowed uses | Prohibited uses | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UDI_MXN | Banxico SIE API | SOURCE_TRUTH for current UDI value | OFFICIAL when fetched from BANXICO_SIE_API with series SP68257 and mode LATEST_VERIFIED | Current UDI reference, cache refresh input, conversion input, forecast input with disclosure | Hardcoded release default, fixture truth, forecast fact, AI-generated value | Forge consumes and labels it; Forge does not own the institutional value. |
| USD_MXN_FIX | Banxico SIE API | SOURCE_TRUTH for current USD/MXN FIX value | OFFICIAL when fetched from BANXICO_SIE_API with series SF43718 and mode LATEST_VERIFIED | Current FX reference, cache refresh input, conversion input, forecast input with disclosure | Hardcoded release default, fixture truth, forecast fact, AI-generated value | Banxico SIE API remains the institutional source. |
| BANXICO_TOKEN | Supabase Edge Function secret store or backend/local env only | SECURITY_SECRET, not market-data truth | BLOCKED from repo/client exposure | Server-side Banxico API authentication only | Repo source, frontend/client, logs, fixtures, tests as real token, AI output, prompts | May exist as Supabase Edge Function secret or backend/local `process.env.BANXICO_TOKEN`. |
| Supabase Edge Function banxico-rates | Supabase Edge runtime boundary | PROVIDER_BOUNDARY, not source truth | VALIDATED when it returns Banxico-shaped rates with source BANXICO_SIE_API | Server-side token isolation, Banxico request proxy/provider, response normalization boundary | Claiming institutional ownership, inventing values, becoming product/forecast/compensation truth | Security boundary and provider endpoint only. |
| shared-banxico-edge-provider.js | Forge runtime adapter layer | PROVIDER_ADAPTER, not source truth | VALIDATED by edge provider tests | Fetch Edge Function, validate response shape, return `{ UDI_MXN, USD_MXN_FIX }` | Reading BANXICO_TOKEN, sending Bmx-Token, inventing values, owning rate truth | Reads `SUPABASE_BANXICO_RATES_URL`; optionally reads `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. |
| shared-banxico-rate-engine.js | Forge backend/local direct provider fallback | BACKEND_LOCAL_PROVIDER, not independent source truth | VALIDATED when `BANXICO_TOKEN` exists and Banxico responds | Backend/local direct Banxico fallback, no frontend use | Hardcoded token, frontend use, release source ownership, bypassing Edge security boundary in client | Uses `process.env.BANXICO_TOKEN` and sends `Bmx-Token` only in backend/local fallback context. |
| exchange-rate-cache-engine.js | Forge cache owner | CACHE_OWNER, not source truth | VALIDATED as cache/copy when provenance and staleness are respected | Read/write cached copy, route configured provider, preserve `cachedAt`, `rates`, `cacheStatus` | Replacing Banxico truth, inventing current rates, product/forecast/compensation ownership | Owns cache behavior and freshness boundary only. |
| forge-rate-cache.json | Forge local cache artifact | EVIDENCE_PACKET / CACHE_COPY, not source truth | STALE or VALIDATED depending on `cachedAt`, source date and source label | Local cache hit, audit evidence, offline decision support with staleness disclosure | Permanent truth, release truth, fixture truth, source of new rates | Cache is evidence/copy only. |
| Projection engines | Forecast / projection domain owners | FORECAST / DECISION_SUPPORT | VALIDATED only for mathematical projection with explicit inputs and assumptions | Future projection math, scenario outputs, assumption-based decision support | Current UDI source ownership, current USD FIX source ownership, forecast-as-fact, invented current rates | Projection engines own math, not current market-data truth. |
| Tests using hardcoded UDI like 8.7 | Test suite / fixture owner | LOCAL_FIXTURE / TEST_FIXTURE | VALIDATED only inside test scope | Deterministic test inputs, regression fixtures, explicit scenario fixtures | Release truth, production default, current UDI source truth, user-facing current rate | Hardcoded 8.7 may be acceptable only as explicit test fixture. |
| AI outputs | Forge AI interpretation layer | AI_INTERPRETATION or AI_CANDIDATE | AI_INTERPRETATION_VALIDATED_FOR_PRESENTATION only after Forge validation | Explain validated Forge outputs, draft language, summarize provenance | Fact, source truth, rate owner, token holder, product/forecast/compensation authority | Forge thinks. AI interprets. |

## Required Ownership Definitions

- Banxico SIE API owns current UDI_MXN and USD_MXN_FIX source truth.
- Supabase Edge Function owns secure server-side token access boundary.
- `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js` owns client/runtime adapter behavior only.
- `shared-banxico-rate-engine.js` owns backend/local direct Banxico provider fallback only.
- `exchange-rate-cache-engine.js` owns cached copies only.
- `forge-rate-cache.json` is cache evidence/copy only.
- Projection engines own mathematical projection and forecast outputs only.
- Tests own fixtures only.
- AI owns interpretation/candidate output only.

## Forbidden Promotions

The following promotions are blocked:

| Forbidden promotion | Lock reason |
| --- | --- |
| Cache -> source truth | Cache is a copy with staleness risk; Banxico remains the source truth. |
| Test fixture -> release truth | Fixtures provide deterministic tests, not real-world current rates. |
| Forecast -> fact | Forecasts are scenarios or estimates, never facts. |
| AI interpretation -> fact/source truth | AI cannot validate or originate market-data truth. |
| Supabase Edge provider -> Banxico source truth | Edge is a security/provider boundary, not the institutional source. |
| Hardcoded UDI -> current UDI source truth | Hardcoded rates may be fixtures only. |
| Product/forecast/compensation engine -> current market data owner | Domain engines consume official market data; they do not own current UDI/USD truth. |
| Client/frontend -> BANXICO_TOKEN holder | Token must stay server-side only. |

## Validation

Validation commands required for this lock:

```sh
git log --oneline -3
git status --short
rg -n "SP68257|SF43718|BANXICO_SIE_API|SUPABASE_BANXICO_RATES_URL|BANXICO_TOKEN|Bmx-Token|8\.7" shared-banxico-edge-provider.js shared-banxico-rate-engine.js exchange-rate-cache-engine.js tests docs/05-truth
node tests/banxico-token-security-test.js
node tests/banxico-edge-provider-test.js
node tests/run-all-tests.js
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
```

Recorded results for this sprint:

- `git log --oneline -3`: HEAD includes `8dcd5eb Add Supabase Banxico Edge provider routing`, followed by `ca44b2a Remove hardcoded Banxico token` and `19e3535 Audit Banxico rate source truth`.
- `git status --short`: pre-existing modified runtime validation files and untracked prohibited paths remain outside this registry scope; this sprint intentionally adds only this document.
- `rg` source-boundary check: expected references are present in provider, fallback, tests and truth docs. `shared-banxico-edge-provider.js` does not reference `BANXICO_TOKEN`, `Bmx-Token` or `Deno.env`.
- `node tests/banxico-token-security-test.js`: PASS, 2 tests passed.
- `node tests/banxico-edge-provider-test.js`: PASS, 8 tests passed.
- `node tests/run-all-tests.js`: PASS.
- `node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js`: EXECUTABLE with zero missing targets, zero missing exports, zero circular imports and zero boot blockers.

Runtime audit baseline:

```json
{
  "totalJsFilesScanned": 712,
  "totalImportsFound": 227,
  "missingTargetsCount": 0,
  "missingExportsCount": 0,
  "circularImportsCount": 0,
  "bootBlockersCount": 0,
  "executabilityVerdict": "EXECUTABLE",
  "confidenceScore": 0.88
}
