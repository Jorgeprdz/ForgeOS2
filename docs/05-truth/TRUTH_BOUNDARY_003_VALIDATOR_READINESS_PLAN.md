## Executive Summary

Forge thinks. AI interprets.

AI SHALL NOT OVERRIDE FORGE.

This plan defines the readiness path for future Truth Boundary validators and guards.

It does not implement validators, guards, schemas, runtime helpers, engines, tests, Alfred behavior, Orchestrator behavior or domain features.

The future validator layer must enforce existing contracts. It must not invent rules, infer business truth, call LLMs, mutate state or bypass ROBOCOP LOCK.

## Validator Readiness Principle

- Validators must enforce contracts, not invent rules.
- Validators must be small, deterministic, testable, and composable.
- Validators must never call LLMs.
- Validators must not mutate state.
- Validators must return pass/fail/block/degrade results with reasons.
- Validators must preserve unknowns and assumptions.
- Validators must produce audit-friendly outputs.
- Validators must never upgrade AI, OCR, parser, forecast, assumption, local fixture, stale evidence, conflicting evidence or discovery content into truth without the required source/owner/evidence path.
- Validators must be offline-first and must not require external AI providers.

## Canonical Validator Output Contract

Future validators should return a conceptual validation result with these fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| validatorId | Yes | Stable validator identifier. |
| status | Yes | PASS / FAIL / BLOCK / DEGRADE / NEEDS_REVIEW. |
| reason | Yes | Human-readable reason for the result. |
| evidence | Yes | Evidence ids, source refs or contract lines used. |
| blockedTransition | Conditional | Required when a transition is blocked. |
| relatedTruthType | Conditional | Truth type affected by the result. |
| relatedEvidenceState | Conditional | Evidence state affected by the result. |
| relatedOwnerType | Conditional | Owner type affected by the result. |
| relatedADR | Yes | Applicable ADRs. |
| relatedConstitutionPrinciple | Yes | Applicable constitutional principles. |
| recommendedAction | Yes | Block, degrade, request validation, allow display, allow decision support or pass. |
| auditEventRequired | Yes | Whether a future audit event must be emitted. |
| userFacingMessageAllowed | Yes | Whether the result can be shown to users. |

Allowed result statuses:

- PASS: contract conditions are satisfied for the requested use.
- FAIL: input is invalid, malformed or missing required contract fields.
- BLOCK: requested use violates Constitution, ADR, ROBOCOP, truth boundary or prohibited transition.
- DEGRADE: use may proceed only at a weaker level, with labels, disclosure or reduced authority.
- NEEDS_REVIEW: evidence is insufficient for automated validation and requires governance/domain review.

## Recommended Validator Families

| Validator family | Purpose | Governing contracts | Inputs | Outputs | May validate | Must never decide | Required tests | Required fixtures | Risks | Miranda approval condition | Board owner/veto | Recommended phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Implementation Phase Roadmap

### PHASE A - Pure truth validators

Objective:

- Establish deterministic validation of envelope structure, truthType, evidenceState and ownership before domain validators exist.

Includes:

- TruthEnvelope required fields
- truthType compatibility
- EvidenceState compatibility
- SourceOwnership

Exit criteria:

- Required field gaps fail.
- Unknown owner blocks truth.
- AI_INTERPRETATION cannot become FACT.
- FORECAST cannot become FACT.
- UNVERIFIED cannot become FACT.
- Validators return audit-friendly outputs and do not mutate state.

### PHASE B - Rule and economic truth validators

Objective:

- Protect executable rules, compensation, forecast assumptions and economic outputs.

Includes:

- RuleSnapshot validity
- Forecast boundary
- Compensation boundary
- Hardcoded rule blocker

Exit criteria:

- HARD_CODED_VALUE cannot become RULE_SNAPSHOT.
- Compensation cannot run without active validated RuleSnapshot.
- Forecasts are decision support only.
- RuleSnapshots require owner, source, effective period and audit trail.

### PHASE C - AI and command boundary validators

Objective:

- Prevent AI, Alfred, discovery docs and local fixtures from bypassing Forge.

Includes:

- AI output boundary
- Alfred search/index boundary
- Discovery implementation blocker
- Local fixture/release truth blocker

Exit criteria:

- Validators must never call LLMs.
- Alfred ranking cannot use LLM guess as primary ranking signal.
- Local/manual fixtures cannot become release truth.
- Discovery docs cannot authorize implementation.

### PHASE D - OS boundary validators

Objective:

- Protect Advisor OS and Manager OS separation, Miranda Wall and human safety.

Includes:

- Advisor OS / Manager OS boundary
- Manager judgment leak blocker
- Human value judgment blocker

Exit criteria:

- Manager signals do not become Advisor OS judgments.
- Manager OS cannot output AI human value judgments.
- Advisor OS receives safe actionable recommendations only.

## Future File Boundaries For Implementation Planning Only

Suggested future areas may include:

- platform/truth/
- platform/truth/validators/
- platform/truth/contracts/
- tests/truth/

These paths are planning candidates only. This document does not create them and does not approve implementation.

Future implementation must remain separate from engines, UI, schemas, routes, Supabase functions, Product Intelligence implementation, CRM intelligence, business logic, commercial rules and package configuration unless a later approved sprint explicitly authorizes a narrow file set.

## Minimum Tests Required Before Any Implementation Can Be Accepted

- AI_INTERPRETATION cannot become FACT.
- FORECAST cannot become FACT.
- HARD_CODED_VALUE cannot become RULE_SNAPSHOT.
- UNVERIFIED cannot become FACT.
- OCR_OUTPUT cannot become PRODUCT_TRUTH.
- LOCAL_FIXTURE cannot become RELEASE_TRUTH.
- MANAGER_SIGNAL cannot become ADVISOR_OS_JUDGMENT.
- Alfred ranking cannot use LLM guess as primary ranking signal.
- Orchestrator cannot consume expired/conflicting RuleSnapshots as active rules.
- Compensation cannot run without active validated RuleSnapshot.
- Validators must never call LLMs.
- Validators must not mutate state.
- BLOCK, DEGRADE and NEEDS_REVIEW must preserve reason, relatedADR and recommendedAction.

## Blocked Until Future Governance Approval

These remain blocked until a future governance-approved implementation sprint:

- runtime validators
- schemas
- DB indexes
- Alfred implementation
- Orchestrator implementation
- Product Intelligence expansion
- Forecast implementation
- Compensation implementation
- Manager OS expansion
- validator file creation
- guard file creation
- engine integration
- test creation or modification

## Future Implementation Acceptance Gates

Any future implementation sprint must declare:

- Applicable Constitution
- Applicable ADRs
- Build Tree area
- Discovery status
- Implementation readiness
- Miranda approval
- Board approval status
- Scope boundary
- Prohibited surfaces
- Validation expectation

The sprint must also name:

- exact validator family
- exact allowed files
- exact prohibited files
- exact test files to create or modify
- exact fixtures allowed
- expected PASS/BLOCK/DEGRADE behaviors
- rollback strategy

If any field is missing, the sprint is BLOCKED BY ROBOCOP LOCK 001.

## What this readiness plan does NOT authorize

This readiness plan does not authorize:

- no runtime implementation
- no validator implementation
- no schema implementation
- no type file creation
- no tests
- no engines
- no Alfred implementation
- no DB indexing
- no Product Intelligence expansion
- no Forecast implementation
- no Compensation implementation
- no Manager OS expansion
- no source code edits
- no route changes
- no Supabase function changes
- no package changes
- no Build Tree status changes
- no ADR edits
- no discovery doc edits

## Recommended next sprint

Recommended next sprint: TRUTH VALIDATOR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 001.

Rationale:

- The governing contracts now exist for Truth Boundary, TruthEnvelope, Source Ownership, Evidence State and RuleSnapshot governance.
- A future implementation plan should still be documentation-first and should specify the smallest first validator package before any code is created.
- The safest first implementation candidate is PHASE A only: TruthEnvelope required field validator, truthType compatibility validator, EvidenceState compatibility validator and SourceOwnership validator.
- Alfred Authority, Product Intelligence Source Registry and Compensation Rule Pack Readiness should wait until the pure truth validators are planned with exact files and tests.

## Final Status

Recommendation: READY FOR VALIDATOR READINESS LOCK.

Miranda approval: yes, documentation-only and implementation-reducing.

Implementation authority: none.

Runtime authority: none.
