## Executive Summary

Forge thinks. AI interprets.

AI SHALL NOT OVERRIDE FORGE.

This registry defines conceptual ownership for Forge truth-bearing sources and claims.

It is a documentation-only ownership map. It is not a validator, runtime permission system, schema, engine or workflow.

## Ownership Principle

- Every fact must have an owner.
- Every metric must have one owner.
- Every rule must cite source and effective period.
- Every forecast must disclose assumptions.
- Every AI output must be labeled as interpretation/candidate until validated.
- Every manual override must be auditable.
- No truth without owner.
- No metric with multiple owners.
- Consumer domains may consume official outputs, but must not redefine source truth.
- Discovery does not authorize implementation.

## Owner Precedence Order

Higher precedence does not automatically win. It may win only after validation, period matching and conflict handling.

1. Constitution / locked ADR / governance_decision
2. official_document
3. carrier_document
4. policy_document
5. quote_document
6. validated rule_snapshot
7. validated rule_pack
8. validated system_calculated output from owned inputs
9. validated advisor_confirmed / manager_confirmed / user_input
10. manual_override with audit and authority
11. external_api validated as official or authoritative for its claim
12. OCR_output / parser_output candidates
13. AI_interpretation candidate
14. unknown_owner

## Conflict Rules

- If two sources conflict, Forge must mark CONFLICTING.
- Higher-precedence source wins only after validation.
- AI cannot resolve conflicts as final authority.
- User input cannot override official source without manual override audit.
- Manual override cannot erase original evidence.
- Stale official data must be marked STALE, not silently trusted.
- Conflict handling must preserve both claims, both owners, timestamps and validation path.
- Unknown owner blocks strong output until ownership is resolved.
- If source owner and claim owner differ, Forge must show the difference and block silent precedence.

## Ownership Rules By TruthType

| truthType | Required owner | Owner rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FACT | Domain owner or validated source owner | Must cite evidence owner, claim owner, period and validation state. |
| SOURCE_TRUTH | official_document, carrier_document, policy_document, governance_decision or validated domain source | Must be source-backed; AI, forecast and assumption cannot own source truth. |
| RULE | rule_pack, rule_snapshot, governance_decision or official_document | Every rule must cite source and effective period. HARD_CODED_VALUE cannot own rules. |
| RULE_SNAPSHOT | rule_snapshot / rule_pack with governance approval | Must freeze source, period, version and effective dates. |
| PRODUCT_TRUTH | Product Intelligence consuming official_document or carrier_document | OCR_output/parser_output may support candidates only. |
| POLICY_TRUTH | Policy Intelligence consuming policy_document or official admin source | Product Truth does not prove Policy Truth. |
| FORECAST | Forecast Intelligence with assumptions and owned inputs | Forecast owner owns scenarios, not facts. |
| ASSUMPTION | User/advisor/system planning context owner | Must stay labeled and cannot own fact/source truth. |
| RECOMMENDATION | NBA/domain recommendation owner consuming validated inputs | Must have owner, evidence and ADR-004 compliance. |
| DECISION_SUPPORT | Domain/orchestrator owner consuming validated inputs | Must preserve assumptions and unknowns. |
| AI_INTERPRETATION | AI_interpretation only | Can own interpretation/candidate label, never truth. |
| USER_INPUT | user_input/advisor_confirmed/manager_confirmed | Can become evidence packet or fact only after validation. |
| MANUAL_OVERRIDE | manual_override by authorized actor | Must audit actor, reason, prior state and approval. |
| HUMAN_DECISION | human_decision by authorized human | Final accountable action, not source truth for unrelated claims. |

## Ownership Rules By Domain

| Domain | Owns | Consumes | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Intelligence | PRODUCT_TRUTH from official/carrier product sources | Evidence packets, OCR/parser candidates, Rule Packs | Policy state, client suitability, compensation pressure |
| Policy Intelligence | POLICY_TRUTH for specific policy state/events | Product Truth, policy docs, admin records | Product rules, forecast facts, compensation truth |
| Forecast Intelligence | FORECAST scenarios and scenario metrics | Facts, Product Truth, Policy Truth, Economic Evidence, assumptions | Facts, source truth, paid income, official metrics |
| Compensation Intelligence | Compensation rule interpretation under rule_pack/rule_snapshot | Policy Truth, Product Truth, Economic Evidence, RuleSnapshots | Forge Core rules, Product Truth, Policy Truth, payment truth without evidence |
| Alfred Search Index | Indexed references to Forge-owned entities and contexts | TruthEnvelope fields, Forge Index, permissions, context | Source truth, LLM ranking truth, governed actions directly |
| NASH / Conversation Intelligence | Conversation guidance, framing and drafts | Product Truth, Policy Truth, Forecast, Recommendation, Relationship context | Client intent, Product Truth, Policy Truth, decisions, manipulation |
| Advisor OS | Safe actionable advisor-facing recommendations | Validated recommendations, decision support, facts | Manager judgments, human capital labels, hidden pressure |
| Manager OS | Governed coaching/allocation signals | Evidence-backed metrics, facts, signals, decision support | Human worth, Advisor OS judgment, enforcement without authority |
| Recruitment Intelligence | Recruitment evidence, candidate process context and governed assessments | Candidate evidence packets, Manager OS boundaries | Human worth, loyalty, future success as truth |
| Conservation Intelligence | Conservation risk context and policy/client signals | Policy Truth, Relationship signals, Forecast scenarios | Policy Truth, client pressure, guaranteed cancellation facts |

## Alfred-Specific Ownership Rules

- Alfred search results are owned by indexed Forge entities, not by LLM output.
- Alfred ranking signals must cite source ownership.
- Alfred may display AI summaries only as AI_INTERPRETATION.
- Alfred must not create source truth from search text.
- Alfred must not bypass Forge.
- Alfred must preserve evidenceState, owner and unknowns where relevant.

Slash search examples:

- `/Carlos` returns owned entities and their source contexts.
- `Carlos Sanchez - Prospecto - Cita de cierre` is owned by the indexed entity and CRM/context evidence, not by AI.
- An AI summary explaining why Carlos appears first must be labeled AI_INTERPRETATION and must cite Forge ranking signals.

## Product Intelligence Ownership Rules

- OCR_output may own raw extraction candidate, not product truth.
- parser_output may own extracted semantic candidate, not product truth.
- official product document or validated carrier document owns product truth.
- rule_pack/rule_snapshot owns executable product rule only when source/effective dates are present.
- Product Intelligence owns Product Truth interpretation, but cannot invent benefits, premiums, UDI, rates, yields or coverage.
- Product Knowledge Library does not automatically create Product Truth.
- Ambiguous Product PDF evidence remains UNVERIFIED, CONFLICTING, UNKNOWN or BLOCKED.

## Forecast And Compensation Ownership Rules

- Forecast owner must be forecast engine + assumptions, never fact owner.
- Compensation owner must be rule_pack/rule_snapshot, not Forge Core.
- Hardcoded values cannot own rules.
- Income projections require explicit source and assumptions.
- Forecast owns scenarios, not source facts.
- Compensation Intelligence may interpret compensation under official rules, snapshots and periods; it may not invent income or promise payment.
- Economic Motivation may explain context, but cannot own economic evidence or compensation truth.

## Manager OS Ownership Rules

- Manager signals are owned by evidence-backed system signals or manager-confirmed interpretation, not AI judgment.
- AI cannot own human worth, loyalty, potential, discipline or coachability.
- Manager judgments must not leak into Advisor OS.
- Miranda Wall remains active.
- Manager OS signals must identify source owner, metric owner and evidence state.
- Manager-confirmed interpretation cannot overwrite Product Truth, Policy Truth, Forecast Truth, compensation rules or human decision authority.
- Advisor OS may receive safe actionable recommendations, not RODI, human capital judgments or hidden manager pressure.

## What This Registry Does NOT Authorize

This registry does not authorize:

- no runtime implementation
- no schema implementation
- no type file creation
- no validators
- no engines
- no Alfred implementation
- no DB indexing
- no Product Intelligence expansion

## Recommended Next Sprint

Recommended next sprint:

EVIDENCE STATE CONTRACT 001

Reason:

- Ownership must be paired with evidence condition before validators or runtime helpers can be designed.
- The next safest layer is evidence state, not feature implementation.
- Rule Snapshot Governance should follow once source ownership and evidence state are both locked.

Alternative planning-only follow-ups:

- RULE SNAPSHOT GOVERNANCE 001
- TRUTH BOUNDARY 003 - Validator Readiness Plan

## Final Status
