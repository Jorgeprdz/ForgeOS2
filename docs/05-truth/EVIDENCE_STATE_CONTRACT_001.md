## Executive Summary

Forge thinks. AI interprets.

AI SHALL NOT OVERRIDE FORGE.

This contract defines the canonical lifecycle states for evidence in Forge.

It does not create validators, schemas, engines, runtime guards, Alfred behavior, Product Intelligence expansion, Forecast implementation, Compensation implementation or Manager OS expansion.

Evidence State is a contract for how Forge labels confidence, provenance, ownership and readiness before any claim can be searched, ranked, recommended, shown, mutated or used as decision support.

## Governing Principles

- Evidence precedes judgment.
- No truth without owner.
- No metric with multiple owners.
- Forecast is never fact.
- OCR is not truth.
- Discovery does not authorize implementation.
- AI output is never source truth.
- Unknown remains unknown until evidence, owner and validation support a stronger state.

- MISSING
- UNVERIFIED
- EXTRACTED
- VALIDATED
- CONFLICTING
- STALE
- MANUAL

## Blocked Transition Contract Statements

- UNVERIFIED -> FACT is blocked because unverified evidence cannot become fact without ownership, provenance and validation.
- EXTRACTED -> SOURCE_TRUTH is blocked because extraction is not source authority.
- OCR_OUTPUT -> VALIDATED without validation is blocked because OCR is not truth.
- AI_INTERPRETATION -> VALIDATED as source truth is blocked because AI output is never source truth.
- FORECAST -> VALIDATED as fact is blocked because Forecast is never fact.
- LOCAL_FIXTURE -> OFFICIAL is blocked because a local fixture is not release truth.
- DISCOVERY_DOC -> VALIDATED implementation truth is blocked because Discovery does not authorize implementation.
- STALE -> recommendation_input without disclosure is blocked because stale evidence must not create hidden confidence.
- CONFLICTING -> state_mutation is blocked because unresolved conflict cannot mutate state.
- MANUAL -> OFFICIAL without governance approval is blocked because manual input is not official source.
- UNKNOWN_OWNER -> VALIDATED is blocked because No truth without owner.

## Validation Methods

| Validation method | What it can validate | What it cannot validate | Required owner/provenance | Can produce VALIDATED | Can produce OFFICIAL | Can drive recommendations | Can mutate state |

## Alfred Implications

- Alfred may index MISSING only as absence context, not as result truth.
- Alfred may index UNVERIFIED/EXTRACTED only with labels.
- Alfred ranking must prefer VALIDATED/OFFICIAL over UNVERIFIED/EXTRACTED.
- Alfred must show CONFLICTING/STALE labels when relevant.
- Alfred must not rank by AI guess.
- Alfred must not bypass Forge.
- Alfred search results must preserve truthType, evidenceState, source owner and unknowns where relevant.
- Alfred actions must obey mutationAuthority and cannot mutate state from UNVERIFIED, EXTRACTED, CONFLICTING, STALE, DEPRECATED or BLOCKED evidence.

Slash search example:

`/Carlos` may return Carlos entities with evidence labels, source owner and next action only if evidence state supports it.

Allowed:

- `Carlos Sanchez - Prospecto - VALIDATED next action - owner: advisor_confirmed`
- `Carlos Martinez - Cliente - OFFICIAL policy context - owner: policy_document`
- `Carlos Rodriguez - Seguimiento - UNVERIFIED note - action requires confirmation`

Blocked:

- LLM guesses that a Carlos is more important without Forge ranking signals.
- AI summary becomes source truth.
- MISSING relationship context is treated as a negative fact.

## Product Intelligence Implications

- OCR extraction starts as EXTRACTED, not VALIDATED.
- Parser output starts as EXTRACTED or AI_EXTRACTION_CANDIDATE, not PRODUCT_TRUTH.
- Product truth requires VALIDATED/OFFICIAL source.
- GMM coverage remains blocked if source registry is unresolved.
- UDI, rates, benefits, premiums, yields and coverage cannot become VALIDATED without source/provenance.
- Product PDFs may create RAW_EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE_PACKET or EXTRACTED candidates, but not final PRODUCT_TRUTH until owner, version, period and domain validation pass.
- Ambiguous product PDF evidence must remain UNVERIFIED, CONFLICTING, UNKNOWN or BLOCKED.

## Forecast And Compensation Implications

- Forecast evidence can support DECISION_SUPPORT, never FACT.
- Compensation requires RULE_SNAPSHOT with source and effective dates.
- Hardcoded values remain BLOCKED for rules.
- Economic projections must disclose assumptions and cannot become official metrics.
- Forecast scenarios must carry assumptions, unknowns, input owner and confidence classification.
- Compensation calculations must cite Rule Pack, RuleSnapshot, period, source, effective dates and metric owner.
- Economic Motivation may explain implications only when evidence, rules, period and confidence are explicit.

## Advisor OS / Manager OS Implications

- Advisor OS can receive recommendations only from VALIDATED evidence or clearly disclosed decision support.
- Manager OS can receive governed signals, but not AI human value judgments.
- Manager judgments must not leak into Advisor OS.
- CONFLICTING or STALE evidence must not create punitive Manager OS judgments.
- Miranda Wall remains active.
- Advisor OS must not receive RODI, human capital labels or hidden Manager OS judgments.
- Manager OS signals must preserve evidenceState, owner, provenance, uncertainty and non-manipulation boundary.

## Orchestrator Implications

- Forge Orchestrator may consume VALIDATED, OFFICIAL and properly disclosed DECISION_SUPPORT inputs.
- Forge Orchestrator must downgrade UNVERIFIED, EXTRACTED, STALE and CONFLICTING inputs unless a domain contract explicitly allows labeled display or reconciliation.
- Forge Orchestrator must block BLOCKED and DEPRECATED evidence for current strong output.
- Forge Orchestrator must preserve unknowns and assumptions instead of converting them to confidence.

## What this contract does NOT authorize

This contract does not authorize:

- no runtime implementation
- no schema implementation
- no validator implementation
- no engine implementation
- no Alfred implementation
- no DB indexing
- no Product Intelligence expansion
- no Forecast implementation
- no Compensation implementation
- no Manager OS expansion
- no source code edits

## Recommended next sprint

Recommended next sprint: RULE SNAPSHOT GOVERNANCE 001.

Rationale:

- Truth Boundary 001 defined truth categories and authority order.
- Truth Boundary 002 defined the TruthEnvelope contract.
- Source Ownership Registry 001 defined owner types and precedence.
- Evidence State Contract 001 defines evidence lifecycle and validation states.
- Rule Snapshot Governance is the next conservative foundation before runtime validators, Alfred authority, Product Intelligence expansion, Forecast implementation or Compensation implementation.

## Final Status

Recommendation: READY FOR EVIDENCE STATE LOCK.

Miranda approval: yes, documentation-only and boundary-strengthening.

Implementation authority: none.

Runtime authority: none.
