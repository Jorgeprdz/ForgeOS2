# R16J2B Accepted Quote Stage Alignment Acceptance

Module: `R16J2B`

## Constitutional gate

- Applicable Constitution: Forge Prime Directives, AI Layer Principle and
  Constitutional Gate for Codex.
- Applicable ADRs: ADR-010, ADR-016, ADR-016A and ADR-018.
- Build Tree area: R16J Quote-to-Sales Presentation / Accepted Quote stage.
- Discovery status: `COMPLETE`.
- Implementation readiness: `AUTHORIZED`.
- Miranda approval: inherited from the Board-authorized R16J2B scope.
- Board approval status: `APPROVED`.
- Scope boundary: module-scoped Accepted Quote stage DOM placement, CSS,
  responsive acceptance, tests and evidence.
- Prohibited surfaces modified: `NO`.
- Validation expectation: local Chromium, regression tests, deployed GitHub
  Pages Chromium and external visual evidence.

## Read-only discovery

Canonical browser surface:

- DOM host:
  `docs/static-preview/forge-alive/index.html`
- Existing action-dock adapter:
  `docs/static-preview/forge-alive/forge-quote-action-dock-r16j1b.js`
- Existing module stylesheet:
  `docs/static-preview/forge-alive/forge-quote-action-dock-r16j1b.css`
- Runtime loader:
  `docs/static-preview/forge-alive/forge-alive-runtime-lazy-loader-r16j1c1.js`

The PDF selector and review-result control lived in
`.fq-upload-controls-105dr`, while the dynamically generated reviewed control,
status and Presentation Editor CTA were inserted as a separate child of the
larger `.fq-upload-105dr` card. The two independent layout contexts made the
status width affect apparent centering and left the editor CTA aligned to the
card edge. No quote or presentation business contract caused the defect.

## Minimal correction

The existing action dock is now mounted inside the existing upload-controls
stage and the stage receives one module-specific class. CSS Grid provides three
symmetric desktop zones, a dedicated status row and a dedicated centered editor
row. At the mobile breakpoint, the same controls stack in semantic order.

No absolute positioning, transform centering, negative margins, JavaScript
geometry correction, duplicate control or duplicate writable authority was
introduced.

## Local acceptance

Chromium passed the complete PDF-to-editor flow at:

- Desktop: `1366x768`, `1440x900`, `1536x864`, `1920x1080`,
  `2560x1440`.
- Tablet: `768x1024`, `820x1180`, `1024x768`, `1180x820`.
- Mobile: `360x800`, `390x844`, `412x915`, `430x932`.

Every run asserted:

- mathematically centered reviewed control on non-mobile layouts;
- explicit mobile control order;
- status and editor CTA on independent rows;
- minimum 44px control targets;
- no document horizontal overflow;
- editor CTA above mobile navigation;
- PDF extraction, review, acceptance, editor open, close and reopen;
- presentation session identity preserved across editor navigation;
- zero console errors, page errors and failed requests.

Regression tests passed for the Advisor OS presentation runtime, ORVI Accepted
Quote wiring and dashboard, Product Intelligence canonical mapping and browser
mirrors, SeguBeca Accepted Quote, presentation pipeline and retirement
presentation contribution calculation.

## Evidence

External evidence root:

`/storage/emulated/0/Download/R16J2B_STAGE_ALIGNMENT_EVIDENCE/`

Manifest:

`/storage/emulated/0/Download/R16J2B_STAGE_ALIGNMENT_EVIDENCE/R16J2B_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.md`

Machine-readable index:

`/storage/emulated/0/Download/R16J2B_STAGE_ALIGNMENT_EVIDENCE/R16J2B_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json`

The evidence includes the required `1440x900` and `390x844` failure-before
captures and local plus deployed Pages pass-after coverage for every required
viewport. The final index contains 62 readable PNGs: 2 failure-before and 55
pass-after captures. It contains no zero-byte or duplicate-name screenshots.

## Deployment gate

Deployment commit:
`386c9d3f50efc194f0dce263311d46b89b4cbea3`

GitHub Pages workflow `29537460900` completed successfully. The public Forge
Alive URL then passed the complete PDF-to-editor flow in all 13 required
viewports. Each run observed 43 relevant JavaScript module responses with valid
status and MIME type. Console errors, page errors and failed requests were zero.
