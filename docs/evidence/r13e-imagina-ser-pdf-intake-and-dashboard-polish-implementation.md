# R13E Imagina Ser PDF Intake And Dashboard Polish Implementation

## Decision

`PASS_R13E_IMAGINA_SER_PDF_INTAKE_AND_DASHBOARD_POLISH_IMPLEMENTATION`

R13E adds product-aware direct PDF routing, reuses the canonical Solucionline retirement parser for Imagina Ser accepted-quote intake, and compacts the Imagina Ser dashboard without modifying Product Intelligence values.

## Constitutional authorization

| Field | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Constitution | `FORGE_CONSTITUTION_V3.md` |
| ADRs | ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007, ADR-008 |
| Build Tree area | Quote Preview / Product Intelligence UI + browser PDF intake |
| Discovery/readiness | Locked and ready with conditions by R13D |
| Board approval | Approved by project owner for R13E implementation |
| Miranda approval | Approved with Imagina Ser-only parser scope and Vida Mujer preservation |

## Files changed

| File | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/static-preview/quote-preview-live/forge-pdf-browser-parser.js` | Adds evidence-based product routing, calls the canonical retirement parser, maps supported Imagina Ser fields to the accepted-quote contract, and returns neutral unknown-product output. |
| `docs/static-preview/quote-preview-live/forge-imagina-ser-product-dashboard-adapter.js` | Adds zero-decimal Imagina Ser presentation formatting, thousands separators, projected-MXN styling, compact construction metrics, and scenario deduplication. |
| `docs/static-preview/quote-preview-live/forge-benefit-summary-renderer.js` | Stops supplying the generic two-decimal formatter to Imagina Ser so its product adapter controls presentation only. |
| `tests/pdf-browser-parser-smoke-test.mjs` | Adds Imagina Ser complete/incomplete PDF-text routing and routed Vida Mujer regressions. |
| `tests/imagina-ser-product-dashboard-adapter-test.mjs` | Adds JSON routing, zero-decimal formatting, compact construction, no separate future-scenario section, and template-layout compatibility assertions. |
| `docs/evidence/r13e-imagina-ser-pdf-intake-and-dashboard-polish-implementation.md` | Records authority, mapping, formatting, deduplication, validation, and prohibited-surface evidence. |

`index.html`, the reusable template, and the canonical retirement parser did not require modification.

## PDF intake correction

The direct PDF path now performs:

```text
browser PDF text extraction
-> parsePdfTextToAcceptedQuotePacket()
-> Vida Mujer evidence: existing Vida Mujer parser
-> Imagina Ser evidence: canonical Solucionline retirement parser
-> unknown evidence: neutral unsupported packet
```

Vida Mujer detection remains first and delegates to the unchanged `parseVidaMujerPdfTextToAcceptedQuotePacket()` function.

Imagina Ser detection is confirmed through the canonical parser's `evidence.productName === "SOURCE_TEXT"`. Filename-only detection is not used.

Consequently, a positively identified Imagina Ser PDF never enters the Vida Mujer packet builder and cannot receive `No se detectó producto Vida Mujer en el PDF.`

## Canonical parser reuse

`forge-pdf-browser-parser.js` imports:

`parseSolucionlineRetirementQuote()` from `product-intelligence/evidence/solucionline-retirement-parser.js`.

No Solucionline product regex, premium parsing rule, scenario parsing rule, or financial formula was copied into browser intake.

The accepted-packet mapper consumes only parser output and evidence states. It maps:

- identified product and `imagina_ser` family;
- evidence-backed currency, age, coverage term, sum assured, and premiums;
- evidence-backed base/favorable/unfavorable scenarios;
- payment term when the parser found a positive limited-payment value;
- parser evidence states and Imagina Ser-specific missing information.

Fields whose evidence state is `MISSING` remain null/absent. Parser fallback zeros are not promoted to accepted quote facts.

## Missing information

Incomplete Imagina Ser text produces an accepted-quote packet with specific gaps for:

- age;
- currency;
- sum assured;
- contribution structure;
- scenarios.

It does not emit a Vida Mujer error. Unknown product text produces a neutral unsupported-product message and is not coerced into either product.

## Visual formatting

Imagina Ser presentation now uses product-specific formatters:

- UDI: zero decimals and thousands separators;
- MXN: zero decimals, thousands separators, and `≈ $` projected-value prefix;
- target age remains explicit when supplied by evidence;
- underlying numeric values and Product Intelligence blocks are not mutated.

Verified examples:

- `607685.9251110773 UDI` -> `607,686 UDI`;
- `607685.9251110773 MXN` -> `≈ $607,686 MXN`.

UDI remains the primary value segment and MXN remains the secondary segment consumed by the existing color hierarchy.

## Scenario deduplication and space use

`Lo que construyes` now contains:

- the base patrimonial goal;
- accumulated values already emitted by Product Intelligence;
- compact labeled base, favorable, and unfavorable scenario metrics.

The base scenario omits the patrimonial goal already shown by the main construction metric. A separate `Escenario futuro` section is no longer rendered.

The construction section uses the approved wide primary-metric layout key while retaining semantic `construction` ownership through `data-forge-product-section`. This uses existing desktop space without changing mobile CSS or adding DOM overlays.

## Vida Mujer preservation

- The Vida Mujer parser implementation and exported API remain unchanged.
- Vida Mujer source text routes to the same packet builder as before.
- Existing Vida Mujer packet fields, missing messages, benefit summaries, selectors, layout, and values remain unchanged.
- The JSON accepted-quote flow is unchanged.
- The renderer's legacy Vida Mujer path remains the default for all non-Imagina products.

## Prohibited surfaces confirmed

No changes were made to:

- mobile UI;
- schemas;
- routes;
- `app.js`;
- rule packs;
- real-client fixtures;
- sensitive data;
- unrelated parsers;
- the canonical Solucionline parser;
- `index.html`.

## Live validation target

## Closure

R13E is implemented within its constitutional boundary. Direct Imagina Ser PDFs now use product-aware intake, and the dashboard presents rounded, compact, non-duplicated evidence while Vida Mujer remains compatible.
