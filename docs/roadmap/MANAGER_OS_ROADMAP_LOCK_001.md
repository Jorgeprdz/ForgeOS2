# MANAGER OS ROADMAP LOCK 001

Status: LOCKED ROADMAP / CONTINUITY LEDGER

## Purpose

This roadmap lock preserves Manager OS implementation continuity after the Manager OS Advisor Signal Consumer Contract closure.

It exists so future ForgeOS phases do not drift, skip dependencies, rely only on conversation memory, or convert Manager OS intelligence into punishment, ranking, promotion, Advisor Lifecycle, Revenue, Compensation or payout truth.

## Constitutional Rules

- Forge decides; AI explains.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Blocked is not zero.
- Missing evidence is not negative evidence.
- Manager Intelligence supports coaching and review; it does not replace manager judgment.
- Manager OS must not create punishment, human ranking, promotion decision, Advisor Lifecycle truth, revenue, compensation or payout truth.
- Advisor OS owns advisor-facing execution context.
- Manager OS may consume official signals but must not recalculate or redefine their truth.
- Forecast is not payout truth.
- Forecast is not compensation truth.
- Forecast is not official revenue truth.
- Forecast is not promotion truth.
- Forecast is not Advisor Lifecycle truth.
- Compensation candidate calculation is not payment truth.
- No stage, commit or push unless explicitly authorized.

## Applicable ADRs

- ADR-003 -- Recommendation vs Decision / Authority Boundary
- ADR-015 -- Manager Intelligence Authority Boundary
- ADR-017 -- Compensation Intelligence Evidence Boundary

## Last Closed Phase

- Phase: MANAGER_OS_ADVISOR_SIGNAL_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_012C
- Status: CLOSED / COMMITTED / PUSHED
- Commit: f0f4cf50b4c5923842a51d4af306414679ab54c3
- Commit message: docs: close manager advisor signal consumer contract

Closure facts:

- Manager OS Advisor Signal Consumer Contract is closed.
- It consumes Advisor OS signals as reference/coaching/review context only.
- It does not create Manager judgment truth.
- It does not create human ranking truth.
- It does not create promotion decision truth.
- It does not create Advisor Lifecycle truth.
- It does not create revenue.
- It does not create compensation.
- It does not create payout truth.
- It does not create punishment or enforcement.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Missing evidence is not negative evidence.
- Legacy default-zero signals require review.
- Advisor OS remains owner of advisor-facing execution context.
- Manager OS may consume official signals but must not recalculate or redefine their truth.

## Current Next Phase

- Phase: MANAGER_OS_ADVISOR_TRACKING_BOUNDARY_HARDENING_013B_C
- Mode: SURGICAL IMPLEMENTATION + TESTS

## Roadmap Addendum 001B -- Manager OS Forecast Intelligence

Status: ROADMAP AMENDMENT / FORECAST INSERTION

### Purpose

Add Manager OS Forecast Intelligence as a formal future workstream after Historical Analytics and before Coaching Intelligence.

This addendum does not replace the current active phase.

Current active implementation track remains:

- MANAGER_OS_ADVISOR_TRACKING_BOUNDARY_HARDENING_013B_C

Next implementation phase remains 013B/C unless a later explicit governance phase changes it.

### Rationale

- Metrics measures what happened.
- Historical Analytics compares what happened.
- Forecast projects what may happen.
- Coaching Intelligence uses metrics, snapshots, historical analytics and forecast context to recommend development actions.
- Dashboard only presents view models and must not create truth.

### Forecast Scope

Manager OS Forecast Intelligence must cover:

- Proyeccion de ingresos al cierre del trimestre
- Proyeccion de altas / firmas de precontratos al mes, trimestre y ano
- Proyeccion de entrevistas:
  - iniciales
  - seleccion
  - carrera
  - adicionales
- Proyeccion de ingresos de asesores al trimestre
- Proyeccion de asesores calificados

### Forecast Boundaries

- Forecast is scenario context only.
- Forecast is not payout truth.
- Forecast is not compensation truth.
- Forecast is not official revenue truth.
- Forecast is not Advisor Lifecycle truth.
- Forecast is not promotion truth.
- Forecast does not create human ranking truth.
- Forecast does not create punishment or enforcement.
- Forecast must expose assumptions.
- Forecast must expose confidence limitations.
- Forecast must expose missing evidence.
- Forecast must expose source owners.
- Forecast must expose freshness.
- Missing evidence is not negative evidence.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Forecast must not consume raw unbounded inputs.
- Forecast must consume protected snapshots, metrics and historical analytics.

## Continuity Rules

- Only one active ForgeOS phase at a time.
- No phase may start unless the previous phase has a result block.
- No implementation phase may start before its corresponding scope/discovery phase.
- Metrics must consume protected snapshots, not raw unbounded inputs.
- Coaching Intelligence must consume snapshots and contracts, not raw metrics.
- Conversation Intelligence must consume candidate/advisor context, not invent context.
- Candy Crush Experience progress is experience context, not performance truth.
- Streak is not compensation truth.
- Level is not promotion truth.
- Mission completion is not Advisor Lifecycle truth.

- missing/unknown/stale collapse
- input mutation
- missing evidence
- missing source owner
- missing freshness
- unsafe direct advisor signal consumption

CONSTITUTIONAL RULES:
- Forge decides; AI explains.
- Unknown is not zero.
- Blocked is not zero.
- Missing evidence is not negative evidence.
- Manager Intelligence supports coaching and review; it does not replace manager judgment.
- Manager OS must not create punishment, human ranking, promotion decision, Advisor Lifecycle truth, revenue, compensation or payout truth.
- Advisor OS owns advisor-facing execution context.
- Manager OS may consume official signals but must not recalculate or redefine their truth.

2. Which modules default missing values to zero?
3. Which modules mutate inputs?
4. Which modules lack evidence/source/freshness?
5. Should they consume the new signal contract instead of raw Advisor OS-like inputs?

## Roadmap Update — Manager OS Through 022B/C

Locked implementation commit: 7901b558a067648edae87f7b71c36b341e5dcc55

### Completed sequence

1. Manager recruitment pipeline capture.
2. Candidate and advisor manager snapshots.
3. Manager Metrics Intelligence.
4. Manager Historical Analytics.
5. Historical storage, rollup, and query-plan boundaries.
6. Manager Forecast Intelligence.
7. Manager Dashboard Intelligence.
8. Manager Coaching Intelligence.
9. Manager Review Plan Intelligence.
10. Manager External Context Bridge.

### Roadmap meaning

Manager OS has moved from protected capture and review snapshots into a complete context-preparation chain. The latest bridge safely exposes sanitized manager context to external consumers without giving those consumers execution authority.

### Next safe roadmap zone

Future work should remain in boundary-first scope analysis before implementation. Any Nash, Mick, engagement, Command OS, Advisor OS, UI, task, calendar, messaging, or runtime connection must begin as a read-only scope with explicit no-execution guarantees.
