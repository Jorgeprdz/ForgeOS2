# 031A Send Execution Gate Scope

## Phase

- Phase: `031A_SEND_EXECUTION_GATE_SCOPE`
- Status: SCOPE CLOSED after validation.
- Next: `031B_SEND_EXECUTION_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION`.

## Closure Visibility Rule

Modulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Why this exists

Forge now has:

```text
NBA Reason Why
-> Prompt Builder
-> LLM Draft Intake
-> Message Safety Validator
-> Human Approval Gate
-> Delivery Adapter Boundary
```

Delivery preparation is not send.

Send Execution Gate is the next constitutional boundary.

The Send Execution Gate must verify explicit final human send intent before any provider/send surface can be considered.

## Current upstream closed layers

- `029B_HUMAN_APPROVAL_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION`
- `030B_DELIVERY_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`

## Send Execution Gate definition

The Send Execution Gate separates:

- approved human communication
- delivery-prepared candidate
- channel/link/manual handoff preparation

from:

- actual send execution
- provider runtime call
- silent delivery
- scheduled send
- task/calendar execution

Send execution must remain explicit, attributable, auditable, channel-aware, artifact-bound, and separately confirmed.

## Future input shape

The future 031B contract may consume:

- sendRequestId
- deliveryRequestId
- approvalRequestId
- advisorId
- managerId
- senderId
- senderRole
- personId
- personType
- channel
- deliveryCandidateSnapshot
- humanApprovalSnapshot
- safetyValidationSnapshot
- approvedArtifactHash
- currentArtifactHash
- finalSendText
- recipientDestination
- recipientReviewSnapshot
- sendIntent
- sendConfirmation
- providerCandidate
- sourceEvidence
- warnings
- limitations
- requestedUse
- createdAt
- confirmedAt
- expiresAt
- now

## Future output shape

The future 031B contract should output:

- sendExecutionGateStatus
- decision
- sendRequestId
- deliveryRequestId
- approvalRequestId
- channel
- finalSendText
- recipientDestination
- providerCandidate
- approvedForProviderHandoff
- providerRuntimeCallAllowed: false unless explicitly implemented later
- sendsMessage: false unless future send executor is separately approved
- automaticSendAllowed: false
- silentSendAllowed: false
- scheduledSendAllowed: false
- humanSendConfirmationRequired: true
- sendAuditRequired: true
- approvedForSendExecution
- blockedUses
- allowedUses
- missingSignals
- unknownSignals
- warnings
- limitations
- createsTask: false
- createsCalendarEvent: false
- createsCompensationTruth: false

- createsRevenueTruth: false
- createsRankingTruth: false
- createsPunishmentTruth: false
- createsHrTruth: false
- createsPromotionTruth: false
- createsAdvisorLifecycleTruth: false
- createsPersonalityTruth: false

## Required rules for 031B implementation

Tests must prove:

1. Missing delivery candidate blocks send review.
2. Missing human approval blocks send review.
3. Missing final send confirmation blocks send execution.
4. Missing recipient destination blocks send execution.
5. Missing channel blocks send execution.
6. Missing artifact hash blocks send execution.
7. Changed artifact requires reapproval.
8. Unsafe safety result blocks send execution.
9. Unsupported channel blocks send execution.
10. Expired send window blocks send execution.
11. Automatic send is blocked.
12. AI self-send is blocked.
13. Silent send is blocked.
14. Scheduled send is blocked.
15. Provider runtime call remains false unless a later executor is separately approved.
16. Send gate does not create tasks/calendar.
17. Send gate does not create compensation/revenue/payout truth.
18. Send gate does not create ranking/punishment/HR/personality truth.
19. Inputs are not mutated.
20. Forbidden uses are blocked.
21. Allowed uses are allowed.
22. Audit is required.

## Relationship to Delivery Adapter Boundary

Delivery Adapter Boundary prepares the delivery candidate.

Send Execution Gate consumes that candidate.

A delivery-prepared candidate is not sent.

## Relationship to Provider Runtime Boundary

Provider Runtime Boundary must remain separate.

031B should not call WhatsApp, SMS, email, or any provider API.

031B may only approve provider handoff/prep if all gates pass.

Actual provider execution requires a later explicit implementation and approval.

## Example scenarios

- Jorge reviews the prepared Maria WhatsApp link and explicitly confirms send intent. The gate may approve provider handoff, but still does not call provider runtime.
- A prepared candidate outreach message is changed after approval. The gate blocks and requires reapproval.
- A missing recipient destination blocks send execution.
- An unsafe message blocks even if send confirmation is present.

## Open next phases

- `031B_SEND_EXECUTION_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Provider Runtime Boundary Scope
- UI / Read Model
- Audit / Persistence

## Forge Council Review

- Miranda: Send is scoped before execution exists.
- Arqui Juve: Architecture stays maintainable because provider runtime remains separate.
- Joy Mangano: Real users need final send confirmation, not silent automation.
- Nash: Conversation support remains human-confirmed before send.
- Mick: Execution support does not become pressure or auto-outreach.
- Patch Adams: Trust is preserved because send needs explicit human confirmation.
- Chris Gardner: Execution improves because final action becomes deliberate and auditable.
- Rocky: Consistency improves because changed artifacts require reapproval.
- Nicky Spurgeon: Outreach remains ethical because silent send is forbidden.
- Jordan Belfort: Conversion remains bounded by anti-manipulation and no-auto-send rules.
- Jurgen Klaric: Psychology supports clarity, not coercion.
