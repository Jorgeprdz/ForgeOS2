# Forge Root Engine Inventory and Build Tree Crosswalk 004

Phase: FORGE_ROOT_ENGINE_INVENTORY_AND_BUILDTREE_CROSSWALK_004

Mode: READ ONLY CODEBASE DISCOVERY + DOCS ONLY BUILDTREE UPDATE

Status: ROOT_ENGINE_INVENTORY_CROSSWALKED

## Boundary

- This phase did not move files.
- This phase did not refactor imports.
- This phase did not edit implementation code.
- This phase did not create tests.
- A detected root-level file is not implementation closure.
- A root-level engine is not automatically source truth.
- Build Tree placement is documentation, not runtime behavior.
- Unknown remains unknown.

## Discovery Commands Used

- `git status --short --branch`
- `git log --oneline -24`
- `git ls-files | rg '(^[^/]+$)'`
- `git ls-files | rg '(^[^/]+\.(js|mjs|cjs|ts|tsx)$)'`
- `git ls-files | rg '(^[^/]*(engine|orchestrator|intelligence|advisor|manager|nash|candidate|prospect|relationship|policy|product|forecast|compensation|revenue)[^/]*\.(js|mjs|cjs|ts|tsx)$)'`
- `sed` reads of authorized Build Tree source docs.

## Crosswalk Notes

- Root-level Nash files map to Nash Conversation Intelligence, but direct runtime execution remains prohibited until boundary-wrapped.
- Root-level Relationship files map cleanly to Relationship Intelligence, but branch-level closure and evidence/source/freshness contracts remain open.
- Root-level Product/GMM/Imagina/ORVI/Vida/Segu files likely map to Product Intelligence, but product truth still requires documentation and evidence packets.
- Root-level Sales Conversion files likely map to Sales Conversion, but recommendations cannot become execution.
- Root-level Policy/WhatsApp/activity files likely map to Policy & Sales Operations, but task/calendar/message delivery writes remain future gated work.
- Root-level revenue and compensation files require source ownership review before any truth claim.
- Generic root engines remain parked in review instead of being forced into false branch truth.

## Suggested Future Phases

1. ROOT_NASH_LEGACY_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY_REVIEW
2. ROOT_RELATIONSHIP_INTELLIGENCE_PLACEMENT_AND_SOURCE_REVIEW
3. ROOT_PRODUCT_INTELLIGENCE_EVIDENCE_PACKET_PLACEMENT_REVIEW
4. ROOT_SALES_CONVERSION_RECOMMENDATION_EXECUTION_BOUNDARY_REVIEW
5. ROOT_POLICY_OPERATIONS_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_REVIEW
6. ROOT_UNKNOWN_ENGINE_SOURCE_TRUTH_TRIAGE

## What Forge Learned

- The repo still contains a large legacy/root operational surface.
- The unified semaforo Build Tree can classify probable ownership without claiming closure.
- Root location is a migration/documentation concern, not deletion authority.
- Unknown root engines need a review queue, not guessing.
