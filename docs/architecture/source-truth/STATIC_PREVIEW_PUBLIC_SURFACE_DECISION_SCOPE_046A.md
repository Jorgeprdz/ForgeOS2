# 046A Static Preview Public Surface Decision Scope

## Phase

- Phase: `046A_STATIC_PREVIEW_PUBLIC_SURFACE_DECISION_SCOPE`
- Status: SCOPE CLOSED after validation.
- Previous: `045B_STATIC_PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Next: `046B_STATIC_PREVIEW_PUBLIC_SURFACE_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION`

## Closure Visibility Rule

Módulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Context

`045B_STATIC_PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION` created a boundary that can prepare a public surface candidate for review.

The existing static preview remains:

- sample data only
- read-only
- not production
- no API calls
- no auth
- no analytics/tracking
- no storage writes
- no forms
- no service worker
- no CRM mutation
- no task/calendar creation
- no truth creation
- no action execution

GitHub Pages availability is not deployment authorization.

## Scope decision

046A scopes a future Static Preview Public Surface Decision Boundary.

046A is docs-only.

046A does not deploy.

046A does not publish.

046A does not mutate GitHub Pages settings.

046A does not create or verify a public URL.

046A does not configure DNS or custom domains.

046A does not execute app runtime.

046A only defines the future owner decision boundary that can decide whether a reviewed public surface candidate may be approved as a public surface decision record.

## Important separation

The following are separate and must not collapse:

1. Static preview files exist.
2. Public surface candidate review passes.
3. Owner public surface decision is recorded.
4. GitHub Pages settings are mutated.
5. A public URL is verified.
6. A production app is deployed.

046A only scopes layer 3.

Layer 4, layer 5, and layer 6 remain forbidden.

## Owner public surface decision meaning

A public surface decision is a human-approved, evidence-backed decision record that says the safe static preview may be considered acceptable for public surface exposure if external repository settings already expose it or if a later separate execution boundary is created.

It is not a deploy command.

It is not GitHub settings mutation.

It is not a publish action.

It is not a public URL verification.

It is not production.

It creates no business truth.

It creates no metric or economic truth.

It creates no CRM/task/calendar/action.

## Future 046B possible output

046B may implement a boundary contract that returns:

- publicSurfaceDecisionStatus
- decision
- ownerDecisionRecord
- approvedForPublicSurfaceDecision
- publicSurfaceDecisionCandidate
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- warnings
- limitations
- rollbackNotes
- expirationNotes

046B must keep the following false:

- approvedForDeploymentExecution
- approvedForGitHubPagesSettingsMutation
- createsPublicUrl
- verifiesPublicUrl
- mutatesDns
- configuresCustomDomain
- deploysApp
- publishesGitHubPages
- callsApi
- enablesAuth
- enablesAnalytics
- enablesTracking
- writesStorage
- registersServiceWorker
- createsFormSubmission
- mutatesCrm
- createsTask
- createsCalendarEvent
- writesCanonicalTruth
- createsBusinessTruth
- createsMetricTruth
- createsEconomicTruth
- executesAction
- sendsMessage

## Future input shape

The future 046B contract may consume:

- publicSurfaceDecisionRequestId
- publicSurfaceCandidateSnapshot
- staticPreviewDeploymentBoundarySnapshot
- ownerApprovalSnapshot
- ownerIdentitySnapshot
- evidenceBundleSnapshot
- riskAcceptanceSnapshot
- rollbackPlanSnapshot
- expirationWindowSnapshot
- publicSurfaceLabelingSnapshot
- sampleDataAuditSnapshot
- secretsScanSnapshot
- apiScanSnapshot
- trackingScanSnapshot
- storageScanSnapshot
- formsScanSnapshot
- serviceWorkerScanSnapshot
- repositoryVisibilitySnapshot
- githubPagesConfigurationSnapshot
- decisionScopeSnapshot
- requestedUse
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- createdAt
- expiresAt
- now
- idempotencyKey
