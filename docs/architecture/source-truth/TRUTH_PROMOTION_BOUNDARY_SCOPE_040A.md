# 040A Truth Promotion Boundary Scope

## Phase

- Phase: `040A_TRUTH_PROMOTION_BOUNDARY_SCOPE`
- Status: SCOPE CLOSED after validation.
- Next: `040B_TRUTH_PROMOTION_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`.

## Closure Visibility Rule

Modulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Why this exists

Forge now has:

```text
NBA Reason Why
-> Prompt Builder
-> LLM Draft Intake
-> Message Safety Validator
-> Human Approval Gate
-> Delivery Adapter Boundary
-> Send Execution Gate
-> Provider Runtime Boundary
-> Provider Connector Boundary
-> Connector Execution Gate
-> Connector Executor Boundary
-> External Dispatch Boundary
-> Provider Webhook Boundary
-> UI / Read Model Boundary
-> Audit / Persistence Boundary
```

Audit event candidate is not persistence.

Audit persistence candidate is not business truth.

Truth promotion candidate is not canonical truth.

Canonical Truth Registry remains separate.

Truth Promotion Boundary is the next constitutional boundary.

It defines when an audited candidate may be reviewed for promotion eligibility without writing canonical truth, mutating metrics, creating compensation/revenue/payout truth, creating HR/ranking/personality truth, creating tasks/calendar, mutating CRM, or executing actions.

040A scopes the boundary only.

040A does not implement truth promotion.

040A does not write Canonical Truth Registry.

040A does not create metric truth.

040A does not create business truth.

040A does not create delivery/message truth.

040A does not create compensation, revenue, payout, ranking, punishment, HR, lifecycle, or personality truth.

## Current upstream closed layers

- `038B_UI_READ_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION`
- `039B_AUDIT_PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION`

## Truth Promotion Boundary definition

The Truth Promotion Boundary separates:

- audit persistence record candidate
- audited evidence chain
- source evidence IDs
- source owners
- source freshness
- retention/privacy/immutability snapshots
- candidate fact type
- candidate fact value
- candidate confidence
- candidate limitation set
- promotion policy snapshot
- metric ownership review
- truth ownership review
- conflict review
- human review state
- audit trail

from:

- canonical truth write
- business truth creation
- metric truth creation
- delivery/message truth creation
- compensation/revenue/payout truth
- ranking/punishment/HR/personality truth
- advisor lifecycle truth
- task/calendar creation
- CRM mutation
- UI rendering
- persistence write
- provider/external API calls
- send/action execution

This boundary may later validate truth promotion readiness and prepare a truth promotion review candidate, but it must not promote anything into canonical truth.

## Relationship to Audit / Persistence Boundary

Audit / Persistence Boundary prepares an audit persistence record candidate.

Truth Promotion Boundary consumes that candidate.

A truth promotion review candidate is not canonical truth.

## Relationship to Canonical Truth Registry

Canonical Truth Registry remains separate.

040B may prepare truth promotion review candidates.

040B must not write canonical truth or create business truth.

## Example scenarios

- Audit / Persistence prepares a record candidate for a provider delivered event. Truth Promotion may prepare a review candidate, but cannot create delivery truth.
- Conflict review detects mismatch between provider event and local evidence. Truth Promotion blocks.
- Candidate fact owner is missing. Truth Promotion blocks.
- Candidate fact value is zero or false. Truth Promotion preserves it as review context if explicitly provided.

## Open next phases

- `040B_TRUTH_PROMOTION_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Canonical Truth Registry Scope
- UI Rendering Boundary Scope

## Forge Council Review

- Miranda: Truth is scoped before anything becomes canonical.
- Arqui Juve: Architecture stays maintainable because eligibility, canonical write, metrics, and ownership remain separate.
- Joy Mangano: Practical utility increases because evidence can become reviewable without becoming unsafe truth.
- Nash: Conversation outcomes remain protected from premature truth creation.
- Mick: Behavior intelligence avoids false coaching based on unpromoted events.
- Patch Adams: Trust is preserved because warnings and limitations survive the promotion review.
- Chris Gardner: Execution improves because truth readiness becomes traceable.
- Rocky: Consistency improves because ownership, conflict review, human review, idempotency, and audit are mandatory.
- Nicky Spurgeon: Outreach remains ethical because action execution and CRM mutation are blocked.
- Jordan Belfort: Conversion remains bounded by anti-manipulation and no-auto-truth rules.
- Jurgen Klaric: Psychology supports voluntary action through explainable truth, not coercive automation.
