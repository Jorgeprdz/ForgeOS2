# Forge Current Implemented Build Tree 001

Status: CURRENT_IMPLEMENTED_TREE / EVIDENCE_BACKED_WHERE_AVAILABLE

Date: 2026-06-29

Purpose: describe what Forge has already constructed or explicitly scoped, without treating historical Genesis vision as current implementation truth.

## Status Vocabulary

- IMPLEMENTED_AND_CLOSED: implementation and closure evidence exist.
- IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_DOCS_SYNC: implementation exists and tests passed, but closure docs are not yet synced.
- SCOPED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: scope docs exist, implementation not yet created.
- DOCUMENTED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED: roadmap/architecture exists, runtime not created.
- PARTIAL: some implementation exists, branch-level closure incomplete.
- PENDING: planned or future work.
- PARKED: intentionally deferred.
- BLOCKED_BY_EVIDENCE: cannot advance without source evidence or validation.
- NOT_MODELED: no current model found.

## Current Message Generation Chain

~~~text
protected context
-> prompt builder
-> LLM Draft Intake boundary
-> Message Safety Validator
-> future Human Approval Gate
-> future delivery adapter
~~~

Boundary:

- Prompt is not draft.
- Draft is not approved communication.
- Safety validation is not human approval.
- Human approval remains mandatory before action.
- `safeForSend` remains false in 028B.
