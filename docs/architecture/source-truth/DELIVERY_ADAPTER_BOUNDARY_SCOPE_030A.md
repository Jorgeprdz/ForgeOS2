# 030A Delivery Adapter Boundary Scope

Status: SCOPE CLOSED.
Next: `030B_DELIVERY_ADAPTER_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`.

Modulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Purpose

Delivery preparation is not send.

The Delivery Adapter Boundary prepares channel, link, manual handoff, copy-ready text, formatting notes, and recipient review context after Human Approval Gate.

It must not send, call provider APIs, create tasks/calendar, bypass approval, or use changed artifacts without reapproval.

## Required rules for 030B implementation

Tests must prove:

1. Missing human approval blocks delivery preparation.
2. Missing approved artifact blocks delivery preparation.
3. Missing artifact hash blocks delivery preparation.
4. Changed artifact requires reapproval.
5. Missing channel candidate blocks delivery preparation.
6. Unsupported channel blocks delivery preparation.
7. Expired approval blocks delivery preparation.
8. Unsafe safety result blocks delivery preparation.
9. Delivery Adapter never sends.
10. Delivery Adapter never calls provider runtime.
11. Delivery Adapter never creates task/calendar.
12. Send execution gate remains required.
13. Inputs are not mutated.
14. Forbidden uses are blocked.
15. Allowed uses are allowed.

## Relationship to Human Approval Gate

Human Approval Gate approves an exact artifact for delivery preparation only.

If the artifact changes, Delivery Adapter must block and require reapproval.

## Relationship to Send Execution Gate

Send Execution Gate must remain separate.

Even a prepared delivery candidate cannot send.

Send Execution Gate must remain separate.

## Example scenarios

- Jorge approves a Maria follow-up message. Delivery Adapter may prepare WhatsApp link or manual copy. It must not send.
- Candidate outreach may be formatted for manual handoff. It must not call provider APIs.
- Changed approved text requires reapproval.
- Unsupported channel returns UNSUPPORTED_CHANNEL or NOT_MODELED.

## Forge Council Review

- Miranda: Delivery is scoped before send exists.
- Arqui Juve: Approval, delivery preparation, and send execution remain separate.
- Joy Mangano: Users need copy/link/channel prep after approval.
- Nash: Conversation support remains human-approved and not auto-sent.
- Mick: Behavior context cannot become pressure or automated outreach.
- Patch Adams: Trust is preserved because communication does not leave Forge automatically.
- Chris Gardner: Execution improves without losing human control.
- Rocky: Consistency improves through exact artifact binding.
- Nicky Spurgeon: Outreach remains ethical because manual control remains required.
- Jordan Belfort: Conversion remains bounded by no-auto-send rules.
- Jurgen Klaric: Psychology supports action, not coercion.
