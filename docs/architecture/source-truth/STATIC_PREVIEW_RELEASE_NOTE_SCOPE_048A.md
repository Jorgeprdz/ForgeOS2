# 048A Static Preview Release Note Scope

## Phase

- Phase: `048A_STATIC_PREVIEW_RELEASE_NOTE_SCOPE`
- Status: SCOPE CLOSED after validation.
- Previous: `047B_PUBLIC_URL_VERIFICATION_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Next: `048B_STATIC_PREVIEW_RELEASE_NOTE_IMPLEMENTATION`

## Closure Visibility Rule

Módulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Context

`047B_PUBLIC_URL_VERIFICATION_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION` created a boundary that can verify URL evidence without performing network calls, HTTP requests, DNS lookups, public URL creation, or live URL direct verification.

The next safe layer is a human-readable release note for the static preview chain.

Release note is not publication authorization.


## Validation phrases

- No publish.
- No network call.
- No deploy.
- No public URL creation.
- No public URL verification.

## Scope decision

048A scopes a future Static Preview Release Note Boundary.

048A is docs-only.

048A does not publish.

048A does not deploy.

048A does not mutate GitHub Pages settings.

048A does not create a public URL.

048A does not verify a public URL.

048A does not perform a network call.

048A does not perform an HTTP request.

048A does not perform a DNS lookup.

048A does not execute app runtime.

048A only defines a future boundary that can produce a human-readable release note from already-approved evidence and closed modules.

## Release note meaning

A static preview release note may say:

- what the Forge Alive static preview is
- what it is not
- which modules are closed
- which safety boundaries are preserved
- which evidence supports the release note
- which limitations remain visible
- which next phases remain pending
- that sample data / read-only / not production labels are required
- that public URL evidence is evidence-review only
- that GitHub Pages availability is not deployment authorization

A release note must not:

- publish the preview
- deploy the preview
- create a public URL
- verify a live URL
- mutate GitHub Pages settings
- configure DNS or custom domains
- call APIs
- enable auth
- enable analytics/tracking
- write storage
- create forms
- register service workers
- mutate CRM
- create tasks/calendar
- create business truth
- create metric or economic truth
- execute actions
- send messages

## Future 048B possible output

048B may implement a boundary contract that returns:

- releaseNoteStatus
- decision
- releaseNoteDraft
- releaseNoteEvidence
- approvedForReleaseNoteDraft
- warnings
- limitations
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- nextPhase

048B must keep the following false:

- publishesReleaseNote
- publishesStaticPreview
- deploysApp
- mutatesGitHubPagesSettings
- createsPublicUrl
- verifiesPublicUrl
- performsNetworkCall
- performsHttpRequest
- performsDnsLookup
- mutatesDns
- configuresCustomDomain
- callsApi
- enablesAuth
- enablesAnalytics
- enablesTracking
- writesStorage
- registersServiceWorker
- createsFormSubmission
- mutatesCrm
- createsTask
- createsCalendarEvent
- writesCanonicalTruth
- createsBusinessTruth
- createsMetricTruth
- createsEconomicTruth
- executesAction
- sendsMessage

## Future input shape

The future 048B contract may consume:

- releaseNoteRequestId
- staticPreviewImplementationSnapshot
- publicSurfaceDecisionSnapshot
- publicUrlVerificationSnapshot
- releaseNotePolicySnapshot
- audienceSnapshot
- messagingBoundarySnapshot
- safetyBoundarySnapshot
- evidenceBundleSnapshot
- sourceOwnershipSnapshot
- roadmapSnapshot
- requestedUse
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- createdAt
- expiresAt
- now
- idempotencyKey
