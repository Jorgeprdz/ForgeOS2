STATUS=PASS

## Purpose

076D decision-locks the Quote Preview PDF Engine repo promotion adapter as a local/static/read-only reference adapter.

The lock confirms that the promoted repo adapter is approved only as Product Intelligence-bound, reference-only, preview-safe, and no-effect.

## Base Confirmed

076C is closed as:

- `PASS_076C_QUOTE_PREVIEW_PDF_ENGINE_REPO_PROMOTION_QA_LOCK`
- `QUOTE_PREVIEW_PDF_ENGINE_REPO_PROMOTION_QA_LOCKED`
- `NEXT=076D_QUOTE_PREVIEW_PDF_ENGINE_REPO_PROMOTION_DECISION_LOCK`

## Locked Meaning

The Quote Preview PDF Engine repo promotion adapter is locked as:

- local/static;
- read-only;
- reference-only;
- Product Intelligence-bound;
- preview-safe;
- no-effect.

## Confirmed Behavior

- Adapter manifest is valid.
- Schema is `forge.quote_preview.pdf_engine.repo_promotion.v1`.
- Product Intelligence binding is required.
- Product Intelligence remains upstream semantic authority.
- Quote Preview PDF Engine remains downstream consumer/reference only.
- Product families are mapped: GMM, Vida Mujer, AVE, Imagina Ser, ORVI, SeguBeca.
- Imagina Ser remains a proven case, not universal architecture.
- Missing/unmapped product family returns safe error.
- Promotion shape validates.
- Reference chain includes 073D, 074B, 075B, and PDF preview engine refs.
- All safety flags remain false.

## Not Authorized

076D does not authorize:

- PDF read;
- parser execution;
- calculator execution;
- Banxico call;
- provider call;
- quote generation;
- quote write or send;
- CRM, policy, pipeline, task, calendar, or message writes;
- backend connection;
- real engine execution;
- invented product, premium, coverage, projection, or quote truth.

## Next Architectural Unlock

077A may scope existing extractor reconciliation only after this decision lock. Any future extractor reconciliation must reuse existing repo extractor surfaces, preserve Product Intelligence binding, evidence/freshness metadata, safe errors, blocked effects, and no-effect defaults until separately promoted and locked.
