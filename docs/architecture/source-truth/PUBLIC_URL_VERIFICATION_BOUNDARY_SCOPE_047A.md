# 047A Public URL Verification Boundary Scope

## Phase

- Phase: `047A_PUBLIC_URL_VERIFICATION_BOUNDARY_SCOPE`
- Status: SCOPE CLOSED after validation.
- Previous: `046B_STATIC_PREVIEW_PUBLIC_SURFACE_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Next: `047B_PUBLIC_URL_VERIFICATION_BOUNDARY_IMPLEMENTATION`

## Closure Visibility Rule

Módulo cerrado sin Unified Build Tree actualizado = NO CERRADO.

## Context

`046B_STATIC_PREVIEW_PUBLIC_SURFACE_DECISION_IMPLEMENTATION` created an owner public surface decision record boundary.

The owner decision is separate from deployment execution.

GitHub Pages availability is not deployment authorization.

The next safe layer is to verify evidence about whether an already-exposed URL, if one exists through external repository settings, points only to the safe static preview.


## Validation phrases

- No network call.
- No HTTP request.
- No DNS lookup.
- No public URL creation.
- No live URL direct verification.

## Scope decision

047A scopes a future Public URL Verification Boundary.

047A is docs-only.

047A does not perform a network call.

047A does not use curl, fetch, browser automation, HTTP client, or DNS query.

047A does not deploy.

047A does not publish.

047A does not mutate GitHub Pages settings.

047A does not create a public URL.

047A does not configure DNS or custom domains.

047A does not execute app runtime.

047A only defines the future boundary that can review owner-provided / GitHub-provided / manual-browser-provided evidence for an already-exposed URL.

## Important separation

The following are separate and must not collapse:

1. Static preview files exist.
2. Public surface candidate review passes.
3. Owner public surface decision is recorded.
4. A public URL exists through external repository settings.
5. URL verification evidence is reviewed.
6. GitHub Pages settings are mutated.
7. Production app deployment exists.

047A only scopes layer 5.

Layer 4 is not created by Forge.

Layer 6 and layer 7 remain forbidden.

## Public URL verification meaning

A URL verification decision may say:

- evidence claims a public URL exists
- evidence claims the URL resolves to the static preview path
- evidence claims the preview label is visible
- evidence claims sample data only is visible
- evidence claims no forms/API/tracking/storage/service worker were detected
- evidence is fresh and source-owned
- evidence is sufficient or insufficient for review

It must not:

- create a URL
- verify through a live network call
- mutate settings
- deploy
- publish
- configure DNS
- create a production app
- create business truth
- create metric/economic truth
- mutate CRM
- create tasks/calendar
- execute actions

## Future 047B possible output

047B may implement a boundary contract that returns:

- publicUrlVerificationStatus
- decision
- publicUrlVerificationRecord
- publicUrlEvidenceCandidate
- verifiedFromEvidence
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- warnings
- limitations
- rollbackNotes
- expirationNotes

047B must keep the following false:

- performsNetworkCall
- callsUrl
- performsHttpRequest
- performsDnsLookup
- createsPublicUrl
- verifiesLiveUrlDirectly
- approvedForDeploymentExecution
- approvedForGitHubPagesSettingsMutation
- mutatesDns
- configuresCustomDomain
- deploysApp
- publishesGitHubPages
- callsApi
- enablesAuth
- enablesAnalytics
- enablesTracking
- writesStorage
- registersServiceWorker
- createsFormSubmission
- mutatesCrm
- createsTask
- createsCalendarEvent
- writesCanonicalTruth
- createsBusinessTruth
- createsMetricTruth
- createsEconomicTruth
- executesAction
- sendsMessage

## Future input shape

The future 047B contract may consume:

- publicUrlVerificationRequestId
- ownerPublicSurfaceDecisionSnapshot
- publicUrlEvidenceSnapshot
- evidenceFreshnessSnapshot
- sourceOwnershipSnapshot
- staticPreviewLabelEvidenceSnapshot
- sampleDataEvidenceSnapshot
- noSecretsEvidenceSnapshot
- noApiEvidenceSnapshot
- noTrackingEvidenceSnapshot
- noStorageEvidenceSnapshot
- noFormsEvidenceSnapshot
- noServiceWorkerEvidenceSnapshot
- repositoryVisibilitySnapshot
- githubPagesConfigurationSnapshot
- rollbackPlanSnapshot
- expirationWindowSnapshot
- requestedUse
- evidenceRefs
- sourceEvidenceIds
- sourceOwners
- createdAt
- expiresAt
- now
- idempotencyKey

- No network call, HTTP request, DNS lookup, live URL direct verification, public URL creation, deploy, publish, GitHub Pages settings mutation, DNS/custom domain, API/auth/analytics/storage/forms/service worker/CRM/truth/action surfaces are authorized.
- Unified Build Tree updated.
