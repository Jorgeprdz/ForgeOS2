## Import Delta

Imports rewritten: 0

Reason:

- The approved MIGRATION-005A batch was restricted to `NO_IMPORTS` files.
- Runtime validation did not reveal a movement-caused missing target.
- Missing target count remained unchanged at 4.

## Root Reduction

Root reduction: 20 top-level JS files.

## Validation Status

### Runtime Module Graph Audit

Command:

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
```

Result:

- `totalJsFilesScanned`: 500
- `totalImportsFound`: 198
- `staticImportsFound`: 196
- `dynamicImportsFound`: 2
- `missingTargetsCount`: 4
- `missingExportsCount`: 2
- `circularImportsCount`: 0
- `bootBlockersCount`: 0
- `executabilityVerdict`: `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`
- `confidenceScore`: 0.88

### Repository Migration Harness

Command:

```sh
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
```

Result:

- `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`

### Diff Whitespace Check

Command:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Result:

- PASS

### Worktree Status

Command:

```sh
git status --short
```

Result:

- Shows the 20 approved Product Intelligence renames plus pre-existing unrelated modified/untracked files from earlier approved runtime and documentation work.

## Remaining Warnings

Existing non-blocking runtime graph warnings remain:

- Missing targets: 4
- Missing exports: 2

No new missing-target warning was introduced by MIGRATION-005A.

## Remaining Product Intelligence Candidates

From the MIGRATION-005 planning set after this execution:

- `INTERNAL_ONLY`: 8 remaining
- `SIMPLE_REWRITE`: 22 remaining
- `COMPLEX_REWRITE` / `BLOCKED`: 9 excluded

## Blockers

None.

## Recommended MIGRATION-005B Scope

Recommended next scope:

- Plan or execute the `INTERNAL_ONLY` Product Intelligence sub-batch with explicit mechanical import rewrites, or
- Keep 005B planning-only and build a rewrite map for the 8 internal-only files first.

Do not execute the `SIMPLE_REWRITE` set until direct consumers and test references are explicitly mapped.
