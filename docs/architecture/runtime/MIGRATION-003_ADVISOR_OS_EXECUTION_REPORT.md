## Import Delta

Imports rewritten: 0

Reason:

- The approved batch was classified as `NO_IMPORTS`.
- Runtime validation did not reveal a movement-caused missing target.
- Missing target count remained unchanged at 4.

## Root Reduction

Root reduction: 57 top-level JS files.

## Validation Status

### Runtime Module Graph Audit

Command:

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
```

Result:

- `totalJsFilesScanned`: 600
- `totalImportsFound`: 199
- `staticImportsFound`: 197
- `dynamicImportsFound`: 2
- `missingTargetsCount`: 4
- `missingExportsCount`: 2
- `circularImportsCount`: 0
- `bootBlockersCount`: 0
- `executabilityVerdict`: `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`
- `confidenceScore`: 0.88

### Repository Migration Harness

Command:

```sh
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
```

Result:

- `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`

### Diff Whitespace Check

Command:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Result:

- PASS

### Worktree Status

Command:

```sh
git status --short
```

Result:

- Shows the 57 approved renames plus pre-existing unrelated modified/untracked files from earlier approved runtime and documentation work.

## Remaining Warnings

Existing non-blocking runtime graph warnings remain:

- Missing targets: 4
- Missing exports: 2

No new missing-target warning was introduced by MIGRATION-003.

## Blockers

None.

## Success Criteria

- Exactly 57 files moved: PASS
- Root reduction 57: PASS
- Boot blockers remain 0: PASS
- Circular imports remain 0: PASS
- No movement-caused missing-target warning: PASS
- No app shell changes for this migration: PASS
- No route legacy changes for this migration: PASS
- `git diff --check` passes: PASS

## Recommended MIGRATION-004 Scope

Recommended next batch:

- Advisor OS UI/viewmodel reserve files and remaining low-coupling Advisor OS commercial surfaces, or
- A dedicated Relationship Intelligence batch for `relationship-master-engine.js`, `relationship-opportunity-engine.js`, and their test consumers.

Do not move Product Intelligence, Policy Operations, or Compensation until the Advisor OS subfolder pattern is reviewed after this execution.
