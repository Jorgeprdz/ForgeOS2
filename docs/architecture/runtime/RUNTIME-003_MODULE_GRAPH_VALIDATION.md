# RUNTIME-003 Module Graph Validation

Report ID: RUNTIME-003
Status: EXECUTABLE VALIDATION / NO FIXES

## Executive Summary

Scanned 722 root JavaScript files and found 237 import edges.

Executability verdict: `EXECUTABLE`

No runtime files were modified, no imports were rewritten, and no files were renamed.

## Summary

| Metric | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Total JS files scanned | 722 |
| Total imports found | 237 |
| Missing targets | 0 |
| Missing exports | 0 |
| Circular imports | 0 |
| Boot blockers | 0 |

## Missing Import Targets

None.

## Missing Named Exports

None.

## Circular Imports

None detected.

## Specific RUNTIME-002 Findings

| Finding | Result |
| --- | --- |
| utils.js imports ./overlay-manager.js | Not detected |
| ./ovelay-manager.js exists | YES |
| callGemini imported from app.js | Not detected |

## Executability Verdict

`EXECUTABLE`

No boot blockers were detected by static module evidence.

## Recommended RUNTIME-004 Scope

Perform a controlled repair plan for the two boot-blocking contracts: resolve the overlay manager filename/export mismatch and resolve the `callGemini` export contract without changing app-shell architecture beyond the approved fixes.

Confidence score: 0.88
