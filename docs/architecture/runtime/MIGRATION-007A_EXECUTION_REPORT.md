# MIGRATION-007A Manager OS Batch A Execution Report

Status: EXECUTED

Commit: `31543d4 Move Manager OS Batch A into domain structure`

## Objective

Move the approved low-risk, no-import Manager OS Batch A files out of the repository root and into explicit Manager OS domain folders.

This migration reduced root runtime clutter while preserving the current app shell, NASH, runtime manager, rule-pack and compensation boundaries.

## Approved Scope

Only the following Batch A files were approved for movement:

- Manager alerts
- Manager communication
- Manager coaching
- Manager feed
- Manager notifications
- Manager roles
- Team intelligence activity, dashboard, momentum and structure
- Recruitment fixture tests already classified as Manager OS recruitment validation assets

Explicit no-touch surfaces:

- `app.js`
- `comisiones.js`
- `supabase-runtime.js`
- NASH master files
- Runtime managers
- `rule-packs/smnyl/`
- `setup.sh`

## Files Moved

## Directories Created

- `manager-os/alerts/`
- `manager-os/communication/`
- `manager-os/coaching/`
- `manager-os/feed/`
- `manager-os/notifications/`
- `manager-os/roles/`
- `manager-os/team-intelligence/activity/`
- `manager-os/team-intelligence/dashboard/`
- `manager-os/team-intelligence/momentum/`
- `manager-os/team-intelligence/structure/`
- `manager-os/recruitment/tests/`

## Imports Modified

None.

MIGRATION-007A was a no-import movement batch. No import rewrite was required by the runtime audit.

## Validations Executed

```sh
git status --short
git diff --name-status
git diff --check
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
```

Validation results:

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- Repository migration harness: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS_ALLOWED`
- Runtime verdict: `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`

## Runtime Audit Result

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| JS files scanned | 673 |
| Imports | 199 |
| Boot blockers | 0 |
| Circular imports | 0 |
| Missing targets | 6 |
| Missing exports | 2 |
| Runtime verdict | `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS` |

No new runtime warnings were introduced by MIGRATION-007A.

## Tests Executed

No focused tests were required for this no-import movement batch.

## Remaining Risks

- Forge runtime remains `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS`.
- The 6 missing targets and 2 missing exports are pre-existing and remain open.
- Recruitment fixture tests moved in this batch required fixture path repair in MIGRATION-007B.
- `setup.sh` remained untracked and was not touched.

## Final Runtime State

| Runtime Signal | Final State |
| --- | ---: |
| Boot blockers | 0 |
| Circular imports | 0 |
| Missing targets | 6 |
| Missing exports | 2 |
| Verdict | `EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS` |

## Next Recommended Scope

Proceed to MIGRATION-007B for the Candidate / Recruitment cluster with explicit import rewrites and focused tests.
