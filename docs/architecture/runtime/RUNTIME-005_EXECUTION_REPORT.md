# RUNTIME-005 Execution Report

Report ID: RUNTIME-005
Status: Controlled Execution
Date: 2026-06-11

## 1. Executive Summary

RUNTIME-005 executed the approved minimal app shell boot repair.

Exactly four approved repair actions were applied:

1. Created `overlay-manager.js` compatibility shim.
2. Added `callGemini` adapter export to `ai-service.js`.
3. Rewrote `prospeccion.js` `callGemini` import away from `app.js`.
4. Rewrote `comisiones.js` `callGemini` import away from `app.js`.

No file moves, renames, domain migration, app shell restructuring, or broad refactor were performed.

## 2. Baseline Before Repair

Pre-flight command:

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
```

Baseline result:

| Metric | Before |
| --- | ---: |
| JS files scanned | 670 |
| Imports found | 194 |
| Static imports | 193 |
| Dynamic imports | 1 |
| Missing targets | 5 |
| Missing exports | 4 |
| Circular imports | 2 |
| Boot blockers | 3 |
| Executability verdict | LIKELY_BOOT_FAILURE |

Pre-flight exit behavior:

- Exit code: `1`
- Expected: yes
- Reason: boot blockers were present.

## 3. Changes Applied

### 3.1 Overlay Shim

Created:

```txt
overlay-manager.js
```

Purpose:

- Provide the import target expected by `utils.js`.
- Re-export `OverlayRuntime` from the existing legacy typo file.
- Avoid renaming `ovelay-manager.js`.
- Avoid modifying `utils.js`.

Applied contract:

```js
export { OverlayRuntime } from './ovelay-manager.js';
```

### 3.2 callGemini Adapter

Modified:

```txt
ai-service.js
```

Added:

- `export async function callGemini(prompt, outputElementId)`
- Adapter uses existing `AI.generate({ prompt })`.
- Adapter writes the returned text to the requested DOM output element if present.
- Adapter returns the `AI.generate` result.

No import from `app.js` was introduced.

### 3.3 Prospeccion Import Rewrite

Modified:

```txt
prospeccion.js
```

Changed only:

```js
import { callGemini } from './app.js';
```

to:

```js
import { callGemini } from './ai-service.js';
```

### 3.4 Comisiones Import Rewrite

Modified:

```txt
comisiones.js
```

Changed only the `callGemini` import source:

```js
import { getSupabase, callGemini } from './app.js';
```

to:

```js
import { getSupabase } from './app.js';
import { callGemini } from './ai-service.js';
```

`getSupabase` remains imported from `app.js` as the known legacy compatibility boundary.

## 4. Post-Repair Validation

Commands run:

```sh
node --check overlay-manager.js
node --check ai-service.js
node --check prospeccion.js
node --check comisiones.js
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
node scripts/repo-doc-migration-harness.js check --output-dir docs/architecture/repository/reports
git diff --check
```

Syntax validation:

| File | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `overlay-manager.js` | PASS |
| `ai-service.js` | PASS |
| `prospeccion.js` | PASS |
| `comisiones.js` | PASS |

Runtime module graph result:

| Metric | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| JS files scanned | 670 | 671 |
| Imports found | 194 | 195 |
| Static imports | 193 | 194 |
| Dynamic imports | 1 | 1 |
| Missing targets | 5 | 4 |
| Missing exports | 4 | 2 |
| Circular imports | 2 | 1 |
| Boot blockers | 3 | 0 |

Executability verdict:

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| LIKELY_BOOT_FAILURE | EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS |

Repository harness:

| Gate | Status | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| protected_root_violation | PASS | 0 |
| runtime_move_candidate | PASS | 0 |
| inventory_schema | PASS | 0 |
| destination_overwrite_risk | PASS | 0 |
| broken_markdown_links | PASS | 0 |

`git diff --check`:

- PASS

## 5. Remaining Warnings

Remaining missing targets:

| Source | Target | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adaptive-question-engine.js` | `./adaptive-question-bank` | DOMAIN_BLOCKER |
| `cartera-view.js` | `../utils/cartera-utils.js` | ROUTE_BLOCKER |
| `smnyl-bonos-engine.js` | `./smnyl-concursos-config.js` | DOMAIN_BLOCKER |
| `smnyl-training-allowance-engine.js` | `./smnyl-concursos-config.js` | DOMAIN_BLOCKER |

Remaining missing exports:

| Source | Target | Imported Name | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cartera-import-engine.js` | `cartera-service.js` | `carteraService` | ROUTE_BLOCKER |
| `smnyl-produccion-engine.js` | `smnyl-prima-engine.js` | `calcularPrimaPoliza` | DOMAIN_BLOCKER |

Remaining circular import:

| Cycle | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app.js -> comisiones.js -> app.js` | APP_SHELL_CYCLE | `comisiones.js` still imports `getSupabase` from `app.js` as a legacy compatibility boundary. |

## 6. Scope Integrity

Protected files not modified:

- `app.js`
- `index.html`
- `manifest.json`
- `service-worker.js`
- `sw-cache-config.js`
- Package files

No moves:

- PASS

No renames:

- PASS

No imports rewritten beyond approved scope:

- `prospeccion.js`: one approved `callGemini` import rewrite.
- `comisiones.js`: one approved `callGemini` import split.

Generated validation artifacts:

- `docs/architecture/runtime/RUNTIME-003_MODULE_GRAPH_VALIDATION.md`
- `docs/architecture/runtime/RUNTIME-003_MODULE_GRAPH_VALIDATION.json`
- `docs/architecture/repository/reports/*`

These were regenerated by the validation commands.

## 7. Rollback Notes

Rollback for RUNTIME-005 only:

1. Remove `overlay-manager.js`.
2. Remove `callGemini` export from `ai-service.js`.
3. Restore `prospeccion.js` import to `./app.js`.
4. Restore `comisiones.js` combined import from `./app.js`.
5. Re-run:

```sh
node scripts/runtime-module-graph-audit.js
git diff --check
```

Expected rollback result:

- Return to `LIKELY_BOOT_FAILURE`.
- Boot blockers return to 3.

## 8. Final Verdict

RUNTIME-005 succeeded.

The three approved boot blockers are cleared:

| Former Boot Blocker | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `utils.js` missing `./overlay-manager.js` | Cleared |
| `prospeccion.js` missing `callGemini` export from `app.js` | Cleared |
| `comisiones.js` missing `callGemini` export from `app.js` | Cleared |

Current executable status:

```txt
EXECUTABLE_WITH_WARNINGS
```

Recommended RUNTIME-006 scope:

Analyze and plan the remaining non-boot warnings:

1. `comisiones.js` legacy `getSupabase` app-shell cycle.
2. `cartera-view.js` missing `../utils/cartera-utils.js`.
3. `cartera-import-engine.js` missing `carteraService` export.
4. SMNYL contest config missing target shared by two engines.
5. `adaptive-question-engine.js` missing question bank target.

Do not begin domain movement until these route/domain blockers are classified.
