# FORGE CONSTITUTION DIGEST 001

## 1. Purpose

This digest is an operational constitutional index for Forge OS.

It helps future implementation blocks quickly understand existing ADRs, addenda, PAQs, boundaries, ownership rules, DENY / ALLOW rules, dependencies, locked phrases and implementation prohibitions.

This digest does not replace any ADR.

This digest does not replace the Constitution Map.

This digest does not authorize implementation.

When this digest conflicts with a source ADR, the root Constitution or the Constitution Map, the source document wins.

## 2. Source Authority

- Root constitution:
  - `FORGE_CONSTITUTION_V3.md`
- Constitution map:
  - `docs/01-constitution/FORGE_CONSTITUTION_MAP.md`
- Canonical ADR directory:
  - `adr/`
- Process ADR exception:
  - `docs/02-adr-candidates/ADR-0019_PROCESS_ADVANCEMENT_INTELLIGENCE.md`
- Working / transition docs:
  - `docs/02-adr-candidates/`
- Governance docs:
  - `docs/00-governance/`
- PAQs:
  - discovery / architecture / readiness material, not implementation approval by default

## 3. Non-Authority Rules

- This digest does not create new rules.
- This digest does not change ADR status.
- This digest does not authorize implementation.
- PAQ material does not authorize implementation unless explicitly promoted or separately approved.
- AI summaries are not source truth.
- If conflict exists, source ADR and Constitution Map win over digest.

- Do not mix constitutional docs with feature commits.

## 15. Known Inconsistencies / Drift

Document, do not fix:

- ADR-001 to ADR-004 status mismatch.
- ADR-0019 location under `docs/02-adr-candidates`.
- `docs/02-adr-candidates/ADR-0021` to `ADR-0026` exist but are not listed in Constitution Map.
- Filename convention drift.
- Operational readiness docs are not canonical ADRs.
- PAQs may be mistaken as implementation approval.

## 16. Future Block Intake Checklist

Before any new implementation block, require:

- Which ADR governs this?
- Which domain owns the metric/truth?
- What evidence is required?
- What is explicitly DENIED?
- Does this require human confirmation?
- Is this advisor-only, manager-visible or scope-gated?
- Is AI creating truth or only interpreting?
- Are unknown/not_modeled/blocked preserved?
- Does this belong in contracts before UI?
- Is there a commit boundary?
- Is there a handoff requirement?

## 17. Pending Blocks

- Evidence Inbox 002 - Contracts Only: paused until digest exists.
- Mi Día Role-Aware Action Runtime 001 - Read-Only Architecture Audit.
- Evidence-Bound Operations Agents: future only.
- ADR-016A implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED.
- Purpose Vault: NOT AUTHORIZED.
- Benvenù UI: NOT AUTHORIZED.

## 18. Final Guardrail

This digest is a map, not a license.
Forge must follow the source ADRs.
When uncertain, choose evidence, scope, human authority, and Client First.
